I have a soft spot for this place, my favorite neighborhood bar. Excellent beers on tap with an easy-going atmosphere. I love their nod to the local scene with all the DC art and playful comics on the wall. The bar is a bit on the quiet side on regular nights - you won't go in expecting to jabber on with your neighbor, but you will always leave content and happy. Perhaps it's the twinkling string lights, the cozy booths or the pacman arcade game waiting to be beat. Or all of the above. The bartenders are great and really know their beers. They also serve tater tots, fried eggplant, grilled cheese sandwiches and a bunch of vegan/veg options. It would be awesome if they had better HH deals though (docking a millimeter on the last star for that). then it wouldnt hurt the wallet as much! On some Sundays they have small, local bands play - it gets a bit cramped + loud, but I love it. You'll feel like family here. And every 1st Sunday of the month is karaoke night! (I have yet to go).
Where has Galaxy Hut been all my life? Oh...hiding in a yuppie neighborhood that I rarely go out in. This dive bar is a great place to chill and grab some beer and food. The staff was actually friendly, which was surprising, as no one really looked that friendly. It's small and can get crowded, so get there early. Prices are extremely reasonable.The beer list is fantastic and they offer happy hour daily. I ordered a grilled cheese with bacon and tomato and it was delicious. Perfectly grilled and melted and it rivals Stoney's. The tater tots were good, as well. My friend ordered eggplant fries and the first batch was cold and overdone. The second batch was much better, crisp and hot. Just writing this review makes me want to go back.
Small, laid back, hipster bar. Great selection of craft beer and bar food -- especially the tater tots. If you are lucky you can get a seat at the few tables they have or the actual bar. You wait in line to order drinks and food. Good spot if you are looking maybe to catch up with a friend, hangout, and have a very low key night drinking craft beer.
I love the vibe of Galaxy Hut. It's super laid-back and not pretentious, unlike many bars in Clarendon. They also have a great beer selection that is reasonably priced.There are lots of fake meat choices for vegetarians, which is good if you are into that (It's not really my thing). The tatchos (tots with melted cheese) were excellent. I ordered the grilled cheese with apples, which was fine, but nothing amazing and I couldn't really taste the apples. I had a bite of my husband's vegetarian reuben, and it was pretty solid, but again, nothing mind-blowing.I probably won't be back for a full meal, but I'll definitely be back for the delicious beer, tots, and, of course, the chill environment.
Came here during the week to meet a friend for dinner and drinks. The location is pretty good with street parking available. The beer selection was great too, I tried a gluten-free cider (didn't even realize it was gluten-free when I ordered!) I had the BBQ sandwich and tots. SO GOOD! The sandwich was HUGE that I didn't even finish it! The tots were very good too. My friend had a grilled cheese and it looked amazing too. It was small and cozy inside and no waitresses; you order everything with the bartender. Will definitely be back here :)
I'll keep this brief....it's MEH...What does that mean - service was sort of slow, beer had a skunky taste to it, which to me means dirty lines....not cool. Had the bacon wrapped dog with kraut, which was decent. Will I go back - not sure, maybe.
Galaxy Hut is my favorite bar of my life. It's been years since I've been there, but it still remains my favorite. Galaxy Hut is a bar for introverts. It's small, it never gets terribly loud (a little when bands play but it's never obnoxious), no one rages. It's dark and filled with colorful lights. It feels safe, warm, close. Teenbeat bands would play here in the late 90s and early aughts. I love Teenbeat. There used to be a DJ that played on Wednesdays. Again, the music was always low key. You can have real conversations here with your one friend or your handful of intimate friends. I returned to the Galaxy Hut after several years of living in the bay area and the bartender recognized me! Like...whaaaat? I used to see him at shows at the Black Cat and such, but I did not know the man and I was not an intense regular, but this gives you a snapshot of the intimacy of this space. I love it. Dearly. I miss it. Deeply. I want a Galaxy Hut everywhere. You live in my heart, precious bar. They have very good beer on tap. I never went for food.
This place is hands down the best bar in Arlington and one of the best in the DC area. Small and cozy, it is a beer bar first and foremost and an Arlington institution-a welcome oasis in what has become frat-by-proxy Clarendon. Great bar food for both meat and plant eaters alike (the tots as others have mentioned are legendary), including the cheesesteak, which comes in either real meat or seitan (I'm a carnivore and my wife is not, and I actually prefer the seitan version-so delicious!) The bacon cheese hot dogs are killer too.And of course the beer. SO many styles/types to choose from and all available in a tasting glass, goblet, pint or pitcher. Stand in line, order your beer and food from the awesome bartenders, have a seat, enjoy the music and artwork on the walls, make new friends, and stumble out of there hours later happy and ready to come back.Oh, and try the karaoke. First Sunday night of every month starting around 8:30. It really packs 'em in and is the most entertaining karaoke in the area. You'll hear all sorts of random shit and get drunk doing it. Good times. Cheers!
Galaxy hut has a very cool, dark, and relaxing atmosphere. I'd probably come here for a drink, but the food is mediocre. WHAT I GOTVegan Seitan BBQ sandwich with vegan coleslaw $8Eggplant fries +$2 with mealWHAT I THOUGHTSuper chill and lowkey. The two bartenders/cooks that were working when I was there had long awesome dreads. The inside is almost all black, except the christmas lights along the interior of the wall. It is a popular local bar, so the place has a decent crowd every night. They have interesting events going on like live music, open mic nights, etc. Definitely worth a visit if you're interested in those things.The barbeque sandwich was too salty and the coleslaw was bland. The bread they use is that nice fluffy white bread (with a nice coating of butter). The meal was disappointing. The eggplant fries were alright. Cool concept.
Hipster alert !Do you like dive bars?Do you like cool obscure microbrews?Are you vegan?Do you think beards are sexy?Do you live in the city yet still wear flannel?Do you think sleeves tattoos are hot?Do you secretly miss tater tots from your childhood?Do you fancy drunk intelligent conversation?Are you sick of the frat scene?Remember arcade games and Pac-Man from back in the day?Could sitting in a silo on a balmy summer night possibly romantic?Edgar Allan Poe ?Live in Northern Virginia and don't want to risk a DUI at the Raven in Mount Pleasant?If you answered yes to any of these questions Galaxy Hut just might the be place for you. Really, it's the hipster version of Cheers...
Galaxy Hut is a very eclectic little bar located in Clarendon. It's surrounded by a ton of other loud and touristy bar spots, so it's quite a gem for locals who want to try something more unique than Mad Rose or Clarendon Ballroom or Whitlow's on Wilson. My experience was solely comprised of eating those delicious $2 tater tots. For just $2, I had an entire basket of tater tots, which brought me so much childhood nostalgia. I stopped by Galaxy Hut at 6pm for some pre-dinner snacks, so I can't say I actually experienced the bar options, but I did love the tater tots and the general nerdy/hip atmosphere. I would certainly return for drinks.
It is an indie hipster bar with beer variety. Nailed it.
I think I found my dream bar.Before heading to the movies the other night, my (vegan) friend and I hit up this place after reading about it online. The guy who greeted us was wearing a sriracha shirt, which was Good Sign #1. Good Sign #2 was the artwork on the walls, which included a painting series of an anthropomorphic toothbrush going about its daily activities (delightful) and the generally laid-back, un-pretentious vibe of a good neighborhood bar. Good Sign #3 was sriracha shirt guy being really friendly as I effectively dumped my bag all over the floor in order to find my ID while apologizing my face off. I found it eventually.Good Sign #4--the menu with extensive vegan options, including a seitan cheesesteak with Daiya, tempeh bacon, and a barbecued seitan sandwich. The food sounded good, and the prices were even better (vegan ingredients are expensive, y'all).#5 was the friendly (and fast) service from the girl at the counter.#6 was the actual food, which lived up to our hopes. It was so tasty. Imagine late-night fare...but vegan! Greasy, hot, delicious, gooey, wonderfulness in giant portions. I was in heaven. We split a pitcher of beer, 2 sandwiches and a pile of tots between us and then waddled off to the movies, stuffed and happy.Thanks, Galaxy Hut. We'll be back.
This place is the most authentic "dive bar" in Clarendon. If you love dive bar / arcade 90s themed venues, you'll like this place. I like how you can order at the counter, instead of waiting for a server. I am not a fan of how rare seating can be when it gets crowded, since there isn't much room to stand and the outside area is small/has smokers. As someone who prefers vegetarian food, I enjoyed the grilled cheese sandwiches. Overall, not really my scene but worth checking out once if you live around the area.
Really like the concept of this place, however one dude working here ruined it for me. When asking what was good to eat there I got a 'can you read' type response. I've worked in the service industry and even if there are limited choices that type of response is unacceptable.
rad place. totally worth stopping by, getting a hot dog, or some eggplant fries. great beer, GF, veeg, other allergy options. real cool atmosphere. chill.come here.:)
Galaxy Hut is the best beer bar in Arlington. It serves as a calm oasis on the outskirts of fratty Clarendon. Just divey enough, with kind, laid-back bartenders and staff. The staff is cool, the music is always fun, the totchos are unstoppable, and the beer is cold and plentiful. It does get a little packed and occasionally the bros invade on the weekends, but they have live music Monday evenings, vinyl nights on Wednesdays, and even on the weekends it tends to thin out around midnight.
What a concept! A place that serves the cheesiest, greasiest bar food (and over 2 dozen beers on tap to complement it) that just happens to also be vegan but only if you want it to be.Galaxy Hut, you had me at the tater tots. $4 for a huge bed of tater tots with a cup of chipotle mayo dressing could go around a table of 4 (or 2... if you're like me) and leave you happy for hours. (Heck, I'm happy just thinking about it right now.)What's great:+ Cheeeeeese+ Cheap-ish+ Lots of napkins+ Serve-yourself ice water+ Attentive, friendly, but hands-off service (...but are you supposed to tip if you pay and order at the register? confused.)+ Portion sizeWhat could be improved:- The vegetarian cheesesteak could taste more steak-y than chicken-y- More pickles! More kraut in the reuben! How else are we supposed to break up the greasiness of the food? (Oh right, beer.)
This place is a bar. Not a sports bar, not a family restaurant posing as an Irish pub, just a bar bar. They aren't even open for lunch. The food is simple and delicious, but its really just there to soak up the countless beers that you will want to drink. They have a great rotating selection, and as a control freak and nerd, I also enjoy the orderly way you have to line up at the register to order. There is definitely room for improvement, though. The arcade game tables seem like a really cool idea until you actually have to sit at one. There is nothing less conducive to enjoying a nice beer than having bright lights blinking on and off right in front of your face. Also, the bartenders can be kind of pretentious. I've asked for a recommendation between two drinks before, and the reply I got was "Well, those are *completely* different." Yeah, fucko, no kidding, that's why I asked which one you like better. Some bartenders seem to hate Dogfish Head for no reason other than because it is popular, which is the definition of snobbery. The bathroom is less inviting than a hole in the ground. I guess a lot of people call this a dive bar or at least a dive themed bar, but it's just a place that, were it not for the beer and awesome food, I wouldn't be caught dead in.
Extensive beer list, fun atmosphere and great local vibe. Galaxy Hut is one of my favorite spots in Arlington. It's a cozy place with a hidden patio area off of Wilson which is busy with much larger bars and restaurants. I've only ever been here for drinks however, they have some tater tots that say my name every time I'm there. I've noticed that they've introduced meat to their menu when they were formally a vegetarian restaurant. I'll make sure to post again when I finally get my hand on some grub here.
Dive bar scene with a top notch beer selection. Small with a really small outdoor seating area. The point seems to be simple: really good beer in ample variety sold in pints, smaller goblet sizes, and taste sizes. Prices fair given the area. Mood was not too friendly when i have gone on weekdays, people just keep to themselves, but bar tenders we're nice and knew what they we're talking about with the brews. They serve food but I have not tried it or even seen anyone else in the bar trying it so I suspect it's pretty standard bar food.
Hadn't been to Galaxy hut in awhile and went last week. Still love the beer selection. Disappointed they removed the jukebox, and very disappointed in the menu change. Am a meat meater and stay away soy foods which have a negative affect especially on women. We had a beer and went up to IOTA for a beef burger.
We were turned away at the door for an early dinner when we arrived with our kid, purportedly because children are not allowed to dine at this restaurant. We've lived in many cities and dine out often--but we've never been refused service like this before. The restaurant was bustling--not a prim and quiet joint that a kid would disturb--and plenty of tables were available. Regardless, we felt this was pretentious and unjustified treatment.
This place was fun. It's a small hole in the wall and they have good beers. The music was good. I'll definitely come back here again.
My favorite bar in the area! Great selection of beer, great food, solid happy hour specials, etc. It's particularly cool that they offer a good vegan selection and, importantly, keep the preparation areas for the vegan and non-vegan offerings separate, so purists can be happy. Great music, too. I love recognizing favorites from my own collection or learning about new artists when I visit.That totchos are a must-try. So delicious. I really enjoy the pulled pork BBQ sandwich, too, though am not as big a fan of the 'slaw (though 'slaw is pretty subjective).
30min for a half basket of tots on a quiet night - ridic......However, awesome beer list and excellent dive bar vibe here without feeling like you're getting infested with fleas. Also sufficiently away from the wazzocks up the road that drink miller lite out of plastic cups, smash empty beer cans on their heads, and walk around shoulder to shoulder on the sticky, puke covered floors of places like Whitlows.
I have been going to this place for years and it is hands down, the greatest place to go in the area. I live in DC and actually make the trek to hang here. Completely unpretentious, chill - great beer selection, and great menu - an entire section devoted to grilled cheese and best tater tots I 've had since I was a kid (plus the best vegetarian cheesesteak EVER)! I'm a California girl and this place is like a serving of home. I should warn that the video games are play at your won risk, but when you get the quarter to work in the galaga table, it's a total score :)
I'm from the area and have always loved this spot. Great beer selection, good food and always interesting people. But holy hell, can the bartenders get their heads out of their asses? Thank you for the privilege of allowing me to drink at your bar and give you my money.
I can't say how much I love this bar in words. I recently turned 21 and have been going around to a few bars here and there and I can honestly say this one is by far the best. The atmosphere is fantastic! The art work on the walls are great, they play great music, and the other patrons are also super chill. The staff is great and friendly, except this one guy who was bartending, but hey, everyone has a bad day every now and then. He wasn't rude or anything, just seemed annoyed. The drink selection is awesome and the food is pretty damn great. I highly recommend the totchos!
I love the Galaxy Hut!! They have a fantastic beer list and pretty much everything on their menu can be veganized. I had a great time hanging out here with my husband and little brother, just chatting over some beers. It's definitely less "bro-y" then other Arlington places we tried. The atmosphere is eccentric and fun.My only regret is that I was too full to try anything from the food menu. Tot-chos, next time I'm in town, you will be mine.
People can be pretty persnickety about bars, so I get why someone might not like Galaxy Hut. The interior has a dive-bar feel. Not much decoration, and the furniture isn't particularly nice. The patio is really a small alleyway with some rickety chairs and tables. But I go here almost every week and wow do I enjoy it.Galaxy Hut has between 20-30 beers on tap every night. The selection rotates but it the categories are pretty consistent: they always have 5-7 IPAs , a few lagers and wheat beers, and then a variety of other ales. Some beers show up more frequently, but every time I go they have at least a few beers that I haven't seen in a while. What really sets this place apart for me is the food. Almost all of it is unhealthy: fried foods like tots and eggplant fries, along with all manner of sandwiches (cheese-steaks, hotdogs, grilled cheeses, reubens, meatloaf sandwiches). Everything has a vegan and a non-vegan version. So if you don't eat animal products and you love beer then this place is Shangri-La. If you are not a vegan then this is just a good bar with good food.The staff is friendly and they know the beers well. Early in the evening it is quiet and a nice place to hold a conversation. It can get loud at peak times but the bar is small enough that things never get really overwhelming.
Best grilled cheese (for real) and craft beer joint in Arlington. Tots! Get the tatchos too! Literally a landmark. Video game tables and cool art. Tiny and divey in a good way. Live music on Sundays and Mondays for $5. Karaoke once a month I believe. Say hi to bartender Art and owner Lary! Great experience every time. *The second place they opened "space bar" in Falls Church is just as good, but with less "stuff" and no Texas toast bread for some reason.
Love this place and it is my favorite watering hole in Arlington. I am a relic from the old days when there was practically nothing in the Clarendon area. Remember Dr. Dremos? That was my number one spot but alas it was replaced by condos as well as many other local haunts. Galaxy Hut was the next closest place to my apt so I figured I'd give it a try.... and I've been trying it for 10 years now. They have a great selection of beer, and the guys behind the counter will get to know you quickly. They move fast and even though the place is crowded I have always managed to find a seat. The food is straight up bar food - Most noted for their tots and if you want to fill your belly with little to spend, the tots are a must, plus they are tasty. I also have the habit of lighting up a cigarette when I drink and thank you again Galaxy Hut for the patio. The prices are fair, bathrooms could use a once over but for a dive bar it is tops.
I'm probably biased because I got engaged there back in 1996, but it still has great beer and food...
I loved the food and the prices but hate the smoke outside that seeps in. The grilled cheese and fries are great.
Best veggie hotdog I have ever had! I go out of my way to try any place that has veggie dogs and this one tips the list. With the great variety of craft beer and the other veggie items on the menu, this place is beer drinking, veggie eating, persons heaven!!
Great selection of vegetarian and vegan items, with one of the best collections of beer on tap in Arlington.The vegan BBQ sandwich on Texas toast was really good. Tater Tots are a must. Eggplant fries--amazing, and I don't really care for eggplant. My partner had a vegan meatloaf sandwich, which was as good, if not better, than the BBQ.I recommend the Sunken City Steemboat lager.Order at the bar, food is cheerfully delivered to your table.Love all the quirky art.
Hooray for vegan/vegetarian bar food! The food is such a treat, and the beer selection is extensive. I will definitely be coming back!
A breath of fresh air in otherwise stuffy Clarendon. Excellent beer selection, refreshing art & music, and all around good vibes. A great place to escape to enjoy a conversation with friends and maybe even to play some old school arcade games. Don't forget to get the eggplant fries!
This place is sooo hipster."How hipster is it?"It's so hipster that, during my last visit:1. They were playing tracks from Radiohead's KidA2. I saw a girl in her mid-20's wearing a Joy Division t-shirt.3. At least a half-dozen ex-frat types came to the bar and asked "Uh, what's the best IPA that you have"4. A tall Daniel Bryan clone, complete with goat face beard, ordered a vegan cheesesteak and tots with vegan cheese.So what the hell am I doing in a place like this?For starters, they have a strong on-tap selection. Yes, it shades a bit hipster - meaning it's dominated by IPAs with a few heavy stouts and Belgian-style beers mixed in. Truthfully, you're likely to find something more unique and hard-to-find on tap at the Arlington Pub above the Whole Foods across the street. But they do keep Left Hand Sawtooth on Nitro, and that makes me VERY happy. Still, if I were rating it for beer selection only, I'd only be giving it four stars.The extra star comes from the food. Don't let all the vegan talk fool you ... they have food for normal people too. They have a great menu of casual bar food, including a number of specialty grilled cheese sandwiches. (Their sister restaurant, Spacebar in Falls Church, has a more extensive grilled cheese menu) I am typically weary of these specialty grilled cheese sandwiches, because they basically just turn out to be a panini. The cheese doesn't ooze like it should on a grilled cheese. But not at The Hut. Oh no. Their meatloaf grilled cheese oozes out of the sandwich like a grilled cheese should. I loved it so much the first time I was there that I ordered it again on my second visit, excpet I switched mozzarella with fresh mozzarella. ZOMG this might be the best thing I've ever put into my mouth. With a side of eggplant fries, I'd be 100\% happy having this as my last meal on Earth.Galaxy Hut strides that fine line between divey and hipster perfectly, and offers a friendly inviting atmosphere, a strong on-tap selection, and a meatloaf grilled cheese that is to die for. They have quickly shot up to the top of my "favorite places on Earth" list.
4.25 starsI'm a bit torn between 4 and 5 stars but despite a bit of aloofness from the staff and the stench of cigarettes in the very small outdoor seating area, I love the fact that Galaxy Hut serves tater tots and has an awesome beer menu.Besides the narrow outdoor patio, there are just a handful of bar stools and the remainder of the seats are at tables or tables made out of old school arcade games. The space is a bit tight but your fellow patrons tend to be nice so the proximity isn't too suffocating. The bar seats are convenient for ordering if there's a lull but otherwise you'll find yourself queued up for the one bartender to grab your beer and ring you up at the centrally located register.Taking my beer n00b friends to Galaxy Hut was slightly intimidating for them and, as such, quite amusing for me. I tried my best to play beer match maker but the eyes of one of these girls seemed to cross just looking at the menu of 28 taps and she opted for the one cider on draft. Despite Galaxy Hut being a couple of blocks from their house, they now refer to this as "my" nerdy beer bar. Just wait till I wrangle them into ChurchKey. Pack up your bookbags ladies, Galaxy Hut is only phase one of beer education. We had a great time playing Miss PacMan and it was super helpful that they can trade your dollars for quarters at the register.Galaxy Hut's happy hour is $1 off beers and goes from 5pm (opening) to 7pm. Nearly all of their food groups have a vegan option including the chili, hot dogs and BBQ.
Some restaurateurs don't think things through and you wonder how they stay in business. While I can't comment on the food because we weren't given a chance and this probably won't affect most of you out there, I had to share. It was 9:40pm and I was with my wife and two daughters aged 7 & 9. After finally finding a seat on the patio and sitting down, we were approached by an employee who indicated that the the owner was strict and it was for 21 years of age and over. While it wasn't listed on the website, my thought was, why have such a unfriendly hostile policy? Why not just accept all paying customers which in most cases especially near 10pm on a school night would not include young kids? But then again, when a place begins to make some money arrogance takes root and soon they are history where they belong.
I would recommend a half basket of tots for $2 ( feeds two) and their beer choices. I usually get the 10\% one lol...their eggplant fries are good too for its price.its not a SUPER nice bar, but a cheap friendly hang-out bar, so if you are in for a dark beer vibe this is the place.
Fun & yum. So happy with the vegetarian food, especially the grilled cheese. The tater tots were a little gross but perfectly so. Larger than anticipated beer selection (although I made the mistake of drinking the pear cider first, which tasted like sugary water).
Love it here! I eat primarily a vegan diet and never eat meat or cheese, so it is amazing to be able to get good vegan bar food (versus other restaurants where I may have only one option of a salad or something). The food here is amazing and they have lots of vegan and non vegan options. My favorites are the vegan cheesesteak and the nachos. A great beer selection too and the people who work there are always so friendly. They don't open until 5 and no one under 21 is let in ever, even just to eat.
Been here twice. The first time was to hang out and have a drink. The second time since my friend recomnended the Philly cheese steak, that is what i got, and he was right, which I rarely like to admit. But I will yell from the rooftop to profess my love for the Philly cheese steak. The guy that took my order was helping me since I couldn't decide between the fries or the tater tots. A different friend said that the tater tots are the best there, but I like fries better. However, I like tater tots too, just less so. The guy said that he could split it in half. I agreed. So I got the best of both worlds. This friend was WRONG; the tater tots weren't all that, and I liked the fries better.Overall, the food and service were great. My only compliant is that the place is dark, and it gets pretty crowded since its a small even on a Wednesday night. I do like the old video game tables.
20 beers on tap. Average of $6ish dollars a beer. Tons of tater tots. A fun clientele. Nice staff. And a small, but "space ship" themed patio. What's not to love? Easily my favorite bar in Clarendon. Scratch that, probably my favorite dive bar in the DC area. I love this place.
Great, cozy space, especially for seeing bands. Very good beer selection, but the taps could rotate more frequently. Vegan options.
Super chill spot, great pulled pork grilled cheese and tons of beers... No pultzers or other German beers, but the wheats were good. Decent music as well. Nice place to catch up with friends or just chill out.
I went last night with a couple of friends and we had such a great time! Great vibes, lots of craft beer, yummy food, and cool art covering the walls? Yes please! The totchos (nachos but replace the chips with tater tots) with avocado and bacon will change your life. Definitely a unique place and a nice change from the typical drunken Clarendon experience. I highly recommend it!
Love this place, and really think with a couple more visits I can see myself adding a fifth star.Phenomenal beer selection. I counted 28 on tap, and they rotate! Don't remember seeing any American Pilsners (Milbudoors) so exclusively craft beer. Not a huge place. I would like a bigger bar, really only 6 stools, and it is a bit dark in there. One small TV in the corner, not showing sports. Definitely a place where you can sit down, have an awesome beer and meet someone new.Great beer. Friendly people.
It's too bad it has taken me so long to stumble in here! Cuz I like it! It's small and divey, they have a ton of awesome beers on tap, the food is good, and all the dudes that work there were chill and laid back. The bartender recommended I try a Baltic porter beer when I couldn't decide. Never heard of a "Baltic" porter but they had 3 on tap - not too shabby. The beers on tap rotate frequently so there's always something to be found.Also, get the BBQ Pork sandwich. It was very good. Sadly, it wasn't until I only had a 1/4 of the sandwich left to remember to put some of the slaw on it....then it was awesome!! Put all the slaw on that baby! You'll scarf it down!
Best bar in Arlington. Good beer, good music, good people. They often have live music. Always an interesting selection of beers on tap. Food selection is good too: tater tots!
I had the opportunity to try out this dive bar with some of my boyfriends friends who live in the area. We arrived when it had just started snowing and it was quiet inside with a table perfect for the six of us. I was impressed at the beer selection which gave us all enough beers to try a couple each. My boyfriend got the meatball grilled cheese, the tater tots with avocado, pulled pork, and tomatoes while I got the portobello grilled cheese. Food was amazing and more than enough for the two of us to split with left overs. I would highly recommend this place even though I can't comment on the vegan menu or busier nights but it's worth trying it out. Also, most of the funky artwork on the walls is for sale!
Much has already been said about Galaxy Hut, but it really is an oasis in the rough seas that are Clarendon bars.Most bars in Clarendon cater to what's in demand: the go-out-on-a-Friday-night crowd; Galaxy Hut is not your standard Clarendon bro-bar, however - it's best experienced by grabbing a beer (or several) with friends and being able to have a conversation, and maybe play Ms. Pac Man while you're doing it.  Double Bonus points if you can grab the silo outside, and marvel at the graffiti that has piled up in Sharpie over the past several years.The food is nothing necessarily to write home about - its better-than-average bar food, with an emphasis on vegetarian. I have to admit though, there's something comforting about picking away at a big basket of tater tots with friends you haven't seen in a while, and Galaxy Hut is the perfect place to do it.
This place has the best atmosphere of the Clarendon area - small and cozy with good music and great craft beer. They have great vegan drunk food (tots and chik'n sandwich? Sign me up!), as well as food for all you omnis. Nice people working there, too.Good luck finding a place to sit during weekend nights unless you come really early or really late. Even their smokey outdoor seating is usually packed.
They have meat options again for food, so basically I'm back to being in love with it!
The times, they are a'changin' since my last visit to "The Hut". Recently, a friend of mine let me know that the menu had changed to something a little bit more conducive to me actually going out to eat there again. He was correct, it has.The menu is no longer all veggie and vegan and whatnot and appears to take some cues from Space Bar in terms of grilled cheese and such. While the beer selection/happy hour/bartending staff isn't quite what it used to be I still feel compelled to tack a star back on and update my review as a result of the menu changes.Kudos!
Great beer, very casual. I would give it a 5 for the beer alone, but the toilets are probably the worst since place in Arlington. Food is basic (hot dogs, tots)
This place was great. It's a super casual bar with a really great beer and food selection. We came here on a Friday night and were able to find a small table and pull up an extra chair for 5 of us. You order everything at the bar where you also can pick up your drinks. They bring the food over to your table though so just pay for it all upfront. We got the eggplant fries which were super delicious! I can't remember all the beers that we tried but everything was reasonably priced.I also realized that there is a door that leads to outdoor seating on the side of the restaurant. Pretty sweet place. I'm moving to the area next month and so I'll definitely be coming back more frequently!
If you're looking for a chill place to hang out with great food and a good selection of microbrews then go to Galaxy Hut. They have some outdoor seating in a little patio/alley on the side of the building. It's been already said by many other Yelpers but its worth saying again.. get some tater tots with your cold beer! For the vegans out there, they have a lot of vegan food options.
No review; we stopped with our vegetarian teenager, and couldn't stay due to the over 21 policy. All good, just would have been helpful to know before we got excited about the menu at home. We'll come back, but we thought it good to share the tip.
My favorite Arlington bar. It has:-Beautiful decoration and atmosphere-Expansive beer menu-Delicious food (vegan and omnivore options)-Cozy patio out back-Friendly staffWith a combination like that, how could you go wrong?
Neat place, great food and fun group of people. We ordered the caprese grilled cheese with the eggplant fries, my boyfriend ordered the apple grilled cheese, added bacon with a side of tater tots. All the food was great, the caprese had plenty of cheese, bread was perfectly crispy and the balsamic was a perfect touch. The eggplant fries trick you, they're very creamy and crunchy on the outside, my friend who tried them didn't even realize it was eggplant. The tater tots are great, but I don't think I've had a bad tot. Now my caprese was great but the apple with bacon, super great, it was great to swap sandwich halves, gave us a lot of flavor variety. For drinks they had a wide variety on tap, and they have mini sizes which lets my lightweight body enjoy a good variety of drinks. I will have to say I pretty much don't enjoy any beer, so far the only thing I like is framboise, which they didn't have on tap, but we did have 4 tastings of different beers. The pumpkin cider, the hard cider, the tangerine wheat and something that had notes of grapefruits. My boyfriend liked the tangerine the most and I liked the pumpkin cider, although I didn't taste the pumpkin. Neat place, worth a visit, was recommended the pulled pork, so we'll have to stop by and test it out.
I guess Galaxy Hut has grown on me. More and more, I find myself wandering to Galaxy Hut when I'm coming up short on new bars to try. I guess it is becoming my default.Oh, and they are adding more taps!
One of the few dive bars in Arlington. Has a good draft selection and an interesting atmosphere. It can be difficult to get a seat/drink at this place though. Really nice when you do.
Wow, Yelp reviewers must be pretty smart--or at least astute. Reading up on Galaxy Hut on Yelp, I saw that it was described as having a "divey, hipster" ambiance. And sure enough, that's exactly what I'd say. While a tad too dark for me inside, it still has a great selection of beers and vegan food options.For a beer fan, this place can't be beat. I love the variety of different sizes that you can get, making it easier (and more affordable) to try a few different types of beers. The "minis" are between $1 and $4 (regular prices), but then there are also goblets (slightly larger) and pints (just what you'd expect). They're pretty much all microbrews--it is a hipster establishment, right?For vegans, there's a huge selection of options which looked pretty good. But being more of a carnivore, I'll stick to drinks at Galaxy Hut!
Cheese steak with tots is on point. Didn't like the seating, but I will return.
i know i'm new to town and we just met and all, but i'm not afraid to say it. i love you, galaxy hut. you are an oasis among the unremarkable, sterile & soulless, predictable and underwhelming norm of this neighborhood. you have an excellent beer selection (bottles AND draft. in pint, goblet, or tasting glass), knowledgeable bar staff, friendly doormen, A+ soundtrack, weird artwork, and arcade games embedded in the tables. you are dark and a little difficult to maneuver and reek of tator tots. you are everything i look for in a neighborhood bar. thank you for being you. don't ever change.
If you're looking for good beer and an indie place to meet friends or first date, this place is good. Not your typical Clarendon bar. Food is limited with a focus I vegetarian menu.
Such a cool place to hang out at. I mean...you just walk in and it feels cool. I wish there was another word to use, but "cool" is just so fitting.From the art on the walls, to the people working there, to the ambiance...it's just really cool.I'll be taking my uncool self there more often, see if any of it rubs off on me.
Galaxy Hut has been on my list of go-to places for some time now. But every time I find myself in Clarendon, the gelato and empanadas at Boccato next door call my name and I walk right past "The Hut". This past weekend, however, after my usual gelato fix at Boccato, a friend and I were chatting outside when a bass player getting ready to play at Galaxy Hut suggested we come in and check out his band - so we did. And we were glad. For a dive bar, Galaxy Hut is as good as it gets. Dim lighting, cool artwork on the walls, friendly service, diverse crowd, laid back atmosphere, and a really decent (mostly vegetarian) menu. I ordered the eggplant fries and my friend had the tater tots smothered in cheese and bacon (which made me oh so happy). We didn't try the beer selection but I hear it's pretty good.Best part about this place (for me at least) - the tables are old school arcade machines. Just adorable. This is a great place to hang out with a small group of friends on a lazy night.
Decided to check this place out after seeing the great Yelp reviews--came here on a Saturday night with my boyfriend and met up with a friend of ours. I moved to the area last year and having been looking for a good hang-out bar with decent food and drinks, and I was hoping this would be the one.PROS:--Vegetarian Food!--Big selection of craft beers on tap--Dim lighting--Once I got outside for some fresh air, I really enjoyed chatting with the bouncer. He seemed really down to earth and real.CONS:--Very crowded and very loud! I had a really hard time finding parking and once I got inside there was no place to sit. At one point there was a line of people waiting for other people to leave so that they could go in.--Kind of creepy decor--lots of skulls on the wall, etc.--Kind of pricey--$8 or so average for one fancy beer.I enjoyed the night I spent here, but I probably won't be going back--it's a little too crowded and feels too strung-out to be a relaxing place to catch up with a friend or enjoy a meal. Expect to shout, wait in line for drinks, and just generally wait. A lot.
I love this bar. Used to be a regular when I lived in these parts and I love I can come back ten years later and it hasn't changed at all. Dark and divey with a hipster glow, awesome beer selection, friendly staff.
The bar itself is okay, but the area outside is loaded with rats. Don't park in the alley behind there. The rats are everywhere. Makes the patio pretty creepy too. All those little beady eyes staring at you.
How do you rate the best bar in Arlington when it borders dangerously (and gloriously) on the "dive bar" category? The food is okay for a dark and dimly lit bar. Its an all vegetarian menu, with most items available vegan as well - GH is known for its tater tots. The beer selection is quite good, with twenty rotating taps and seasonal offerings. The walls are decorated with crazy, colorful art and there are several old video games available. It can be a hassle to find a seat, but there is an alleyway for smokers thats quite pleasant in the warm weather. There is live music on most Sunday and Monday nights and karaoke isn't unheard of if you're into that. All that said, I love Galaxy Hut and it is easily my favorite bar in Arlington.
"Hipster, liberal, vegan, pretty cool spot"Food: 5/5Service: 3/5 Atmosphere: 4/5Parking: 1/5Cleanliness: 3/5  Galaxy hut is located in a very frat-based community area full of young, hip college kids who are often socially conscious and appreciative of vegan cuisine and its health and environmental benefits.   Food here is excellent, especially for such a small little dive bar. The vegan steak and cheese, tater tots, and sausage all taste amazing and all the meat substitutes are actually very flavorful and taste like / have the texture of, real meat.   Service in this loud bar is done at the bar itself where there is an amazing selection of craft beers (hipster-ness flows through this place) and all at reasonable prices. Otherwise, there is no table service beyond the actual delivery of entres, which can be annoying as there is a line to request or get anything here so prepare yourself.   Dcor is expectedly odd with modern-art murals of wacky characters on the walls, a neat outdoor alley converted into a seating area where smoking is allowed and guests enjoy a view of other bars and happenings on this crowded street.   Parking is horrendous but what'd you expect from this area? It's highly urban so intend on all arriving in one vehicle and paying for parking. Otherwise, enjoy Galaxy Hut, it's certainly an experience
#55What an awesome Dive Bar! Love the dcor and the dive feel at this place! They've got a pacman (one side works), pinball machine (doesnt work), and an android game?(doesnt work). lol ghetto. But it makes an awesome entertaining table! That's about the extent of the credibility of my review. I'm not very knowledgeable about beer so it's hard to speak on behalf of it but they do have a wide selection to choose from, I was able to use my "I just want a light, refreshing, crisp, belgian beer" phrase and was good to go. That's what I got! I've heard and seen that their infamous tator tots are a must try but will have to do this the second time around. I missed out on this unfortunately and I absolutely LOVE tator tots!!
There is nothing not to love about this place. Excellent beer selection. Reasonably cool people hanging out at the bar. I've been here to drink but not really tried the food except for a few tater tots. The tots were excellent. As far as I know, the place is vegetarian. From what I've seen leaving the kitchen it looks damn good.Highly recommended. Reasonably priced.Piece de resistance...arcade machine tables. Sweetness.
Great dive bar. This is a place for chill people. Bad reviews are definitely from the frat boys and ladies who are stuck in a permanent cringe face here. This is more of Brooklyn type joint. Love it. Highly recommend the beer selection, and the staff is knowledgeable and can bounce off what you like to make suggestions.
I haven't been here in a few years. A few of us were in the neighborhood and were pleased to find out that they had happy hour even on Saturday! So we went. The menu looked kind of eh. There was nothing on it that really stood out and then I realized it was because everything was Vegan- an odd choice for a bar, but whatever. Vegan is fine, but it would have been nice to have some non-Vegan options. At least the prices were right! I appreciate that they had a few porters and stouts on their beer menu, which is always nice to see, but especially in the summer months! The bourbon stout I ordered was excellent! The layout of the place is kind of cramped, but cozy. It's dark and bordering on dreary. The classic arcade game tables are a major plus. I prefer to come on nights when they don't have a band because it can be so crowded, but it's nice that they have that going for them. The bathrooms are small and kind of gross, but it's a bar so what should I expect? They have the option of an outdoor patio, which I assumed was for fresh air, but apparently it's for smokers. A Vegan menu and a smoking patio? I think they need to rearrange their health priorities. Overall, there are a lot of things that I appreciate about this place (longevity, tots, bourbon stouts), but I don;t think I would go there often. Especially when there are other places that are just as quirky, but with better menus and atmosphere (namely, their counterpart Spacebar).3.5 stars!
Friend's birthday last night - we ended up at Galaxy Hut after eating dinner nearby. I've been to G.H. a few times but not very recently. The service was better & more friendly than the place we had gone to dinner at. Luckily we ended up snagging a table inside not too long after we arrived. I wouldn't say this place is good for groups as there is not much seating. We had a party of 6 & got lucky, to say the least, with the table we got. There is a patio outside; it's more of a long corridor but unless you smoke, I wouldn't recommend it as it is quite close & the smoke would most likely be bothersome. I don't drink beer, but the other members of our group easily found good beer to drink, including a good one called "Monkey King." Not sure how the prices are since I didn't buy any drinks. They also serve food but we didn't buy any. There was a marked "fried food" smell for most of the evening which unfortunately permeated our clothes. The music playing in the background (not too loud - just perfect) was great: We heard R.E.M. and Siouxsie & The Banshees amongst others. When we were ready to leave I was shocked to hear my favorite New Order song ("Your Silent Face") come on.P.S. I really like the silver letters that they use for their sign which hang in the front window.
Awesome vegan bar food, and great environment. I've been looking for a bar like this!
Went for the feat time last week and aside from the awesome bartender, I love the extensive beer lost and arcade game tables. This place is great for a low-key casual night!Did I mention how great the bartender was - I couldn't decide between a few beers, so without even asking, he gave me samples of each of them! Next time I will have to try the food...
Went to the Galaxy Hut for the first time yesterday. It is a small place, it was karoke night and it was packed.  Had a great beer and some great food there. I am vegan and the vegan selection is amazing. The area has horrible parking but I just parked in the parking garage. I should have asked it they validated parking. Definitely coming back!
Great dive bar! It's a nice spot to go to chill, talk to some friends, and drink some good draft beer. Very different from the majority of the other bars in Clarendon. I will definitely be going back here!
Arrived right at 5 when they begin serving dinner and watched the place fill up immediately after. Split the vegan chili nachos, and got myself a vegan "chicken" and "bacon" sandwich. delicious!
Went there on a Wednesday night and the only table left was a PacMan game. Why not? You have to order your drinks and food at the bar. No big deal. You pour your own water if you want it. But the host is genial and helpful and what could be wrong with vegan bar food? For this long-time vegetarian it was great being able to order anything on the bar menu: a veggie burger, hot dog, "meatloaf," or sausage. I went with the "sausage" sandwich with everything. It was great, meaty and delish. We also ordered tater tots. They were greasy and I ate too many. Good, clean fun. I'd go back--but maybe not for a few weeks.
We were both craving a good porter or stout after dinner and decided to hop into Galaxy Hut. A little surprised at the menu as there was neither a porter nor a stout (not counting the bourbon stout) on the menu. We made different selections and hoped for the best. I ordered a Bison Organic Honey Basil Ale and E got the Ballast Point Sculpin IPA. I went with the Honey Basil Ale on a little bit of a whim but it was actually really good, if you like basil. Every seat was taken inside but it was a nice enough night to take our beers outside and enjoy them under the heat lamps. Looking forward to returning as I just moved to Arlington, a short walk from Galaxy Hut.
Not as hectic as some of the bars in the area so it can be nice to relax in, but not my favorite in beer choices. The place is pretty small so it might get a little crowded with people waiting for seats, but there is a patio outside with more seating. The patio is a bit creepy looking, but nothing anybody can't deal with.
As a longtime resident of Northern Virginia, I was schooled in the Fairfax County Public School system. One of my favorite memories from this delicate period of my life was Tater Tot days. Thank God I lived in the days before Jamie Oliver, where eating a tater tot was considered fulfillment of consuming from the fruits and vegetable food group!Fast forward twenty years, and I find myself at Galaxy Hut eating my favorite childhood snack. Only this time, instead of sipping on milk in a recyclable plastic pouch, I'm drinking a wonderfully hoppy craft brew in a goblet. I can't help but hum the first few lines of Notorious BIG's "Juicy" whenever I am here....Can you see why this place is so loved by Arlington residents?It's dim, it's low key, and they provide warm service and a menu full of childhood favorites done right. The arcade tables don't hurt either!
Two ways to describe this place: INCREDIBLY chill and the best selection of beer in Arlington (and maybe even the DC area). You're not going to find Miller Lite here, but some of the best IPAs, porters, ciders, stouts, and lagers around the world. The beer menu changes, too, so make sure you keep going back.
I've been here thrice on Fridays and am sooo happy there's an alternative to the "broseph" bars in the Clarendon area. I'm definitely not a hipster, but still feel comfortable even when it gets crowded (small space, it happens). Cool art on the walls and good music at just the right volume. The beer selection is awesome, although they need a full beer menu on the wall or bigger font on the register menu. This is because I am indecisive and freak out having to order quickly when I get to the front of the line. :-) Oh, and gimme some of your tots, they are delicious!
Great beer selection containing lots of beers that you've probably never heard of. I am not vegan, but the vegan chili mac was very good and the large basket of sweet potato fries were even better.It is refreshing to have a low key place like this in Arlington. People of all different ages are present and less fratty than the majority of Clarendon. On the downside the place is small and parking can be tricky if you drive in.
Great little beer bar, my favorite spot in Arlington. Cool atmosphere, nice beer selection and tater tots!
I've come here twice now, disappointed both times.As for the beers- yes great selection but don't expect to get any tips from the bartender. "How's this beer?", response- "its good". Um, awesome. Let's try this again, "what about this one", response- "its pretty crazy." Wow.As for the vegan food, its only something you'd want to eat when you're drunk. Oh, and shouts to the meathead "chef" who burned our sweet potato fries because he was too busy working on his dance moves in the back (keep working on them).
Great food and great drinks. Menu is all vegan and vegetarian. I had a bbq seitan sandwich that was amazing. My friends had vegan cheesesteaks and chicken sandwiches which they liked, but everyone agreed my sandwich was best. Lots of beers on tap, bottled, and canned. Service was a bit slow but friendly. My biggest complaint is the size- the inside restaurant is very cramped. Close to Clarendon metro.
Went to Galaxy Hut on a Tuesday night for drinks. It's walking distance from the metro which was nice. They have a very unique beer selection which is awesome. There menu is all vegetarian dishes which doesn't really appeal to me, but I went for drinks and not food, so my review does not reflect their food selection. Although, I did order their tots to munch on. They were made to order and were hot and crispy when they arrived.It was a nice environment to grab drinks on a weekday night. You order your drinks at the register, then you can take it to whatever table you want to sit at. I liked this since I could enjoy a conversation without a server checking up on me every 10 minutes. So my reason for 3 stars is that there were flies inside the restaurant. I wouldn't have minded as much, except that they were hovering around my beer. This made me concerned about finding dead flies in my drink throughout the night. Otherwise, awesome beers and a relaxing and chill environment.
I love this place, and frequently recommend it to friends who are vegan or vegetarian. The food is so delicious. I've told my husband that my last meal would be their vegetarian chili cheese dogs, onion rings, and hard cider. It is a perfect meal. Plus, the vibe/decor/crowd is very laid back...so bonus points for allowing me to wear comfy tennis shoes!Why not 5 stars? Galaxy Hut gets very crowded very early in the evening. You have to arrive by 7pm to get a seat. I wish they would expand or relocate nearby for more room.
I love this bar. It's small, not too loud, has a few cool old arcade games, and great quirky artwork on the walls. They have a really good beer selection and tasty food, including some good vegetarian options and awesome tater tots. On Sunday and Monday nights, there's a band playing. There is a patio, but it tends to get very smoky, so I tend to stay inside even if the weather's nice out. This has been one of my favorite Arlington bars for several years. It's definitely got a little bit of a hipster vibe, but isn't too pretentious, and is always a better option than the mid-20's-aged frat party I've run into at many of the other Clarendon area bars.
Good beer selection and pleasant vibe contribute to this gem of a pub. Some 15+ taps, efficient service even when busy, hardwood floors and an outside area make this a busy place on weekend nights, but well worth it. I would make this my local go to bar if I lived in the area.
This use to be my go to spot when I lived in Arlington. Much of my 20;s was spent here and glad to see not much has changed. Still super tiny, still funky art on the walls. Still has good mix of beers. While I didn't recognize most the people there it was still friendly. Glad to see the veggie friendly menu.
Crowded, but a great selection of beer! Friendly staff and patrons.
A perfect club. Great food, great bartenders, and an amazingly intimate stage. The sort of place that every city needs.
Now if only all bars were like this - vegan friendly! When I eat out at bars, I usually get stuck with either a veggie burger or a salad. Or tater tots (no complaints there). But at Galaxy Hut, I can get tots and so much more!All of the items listed are meatless and available vegan. Plus, they have two of my favorite bar food weaknesses - tater tots and vegan nachos! I've only been here twice and have tried the vegan cheesesteak and the seitan BBQ sandwich (and the vegan nachos, and tots, of course). It's not the healthiest vegan food nor the fanciest, but I love that I can be a little bad here. My fellow veg friend noticed on the back of the menu that you can get meat if you ask for it - I love the way it's worded, since in the non-veg world we live in, it's usually the opposite. It's been really crowded each time I've been here - sort of a battle to find space if you can (we got take out the first time because there wasn't any space). They do have a heated patio, but it's not smoke-free, and hence not a good option for me. The bartender was super nice the last time I was there - but ordering can back up since you order at the bar (and there only seems to be one bartender). They also have live music (with a cover, at least the night we were there).
I'm a big fan of anybody that has an all vegetarian menu, with the ability to make everything vegan. :) More places should be like this! PLUS - as much as I'd prefer this didn't happen, they have the possibility to make anything meat (meat burger instead of veggie, etc) if you reeeeeally want. So everybody's happy! But the focus is on being veg, which I appreciate.Plus they were really nice, really helpful, really chill... and not just to us. My friend with was playing there with a band, and she said they're one of the best places for bands to play. Gotta like supporting that! They have a great interesting list of beers on tap, plus the ability to order mini (4 oz) pours, so you can try a number of things, which is always my favorite thing to do. The food was good, the beer plentiful, the people nice, and the atmosphere was perfectly chill and relaxed, hole-in-the-wall... love it.
2.5 Stars from MeIf you're the kind of guy who enjoys outfitting yourself with tight pants, over-sized thick-rimmed glasses, scarves, etc, then you're going to love this place. If you're the kind of girl that likes that kind of guy, leave your panties at home. Galaxy Hut gets bonus hipster points for its focus on vegetarian and vegan foods.The bar itself is small and gets uncomfortably cramped very quickly, but it's a great place to actually have a conversation with people without losing your voice the next day. Service is slow, but orderly. There is a single line for those ordering food/drink who are not sitting at the bar. It's very orderly this way, and it's great for not dealing with split checks at the end of the night. But be prepared to wait, as no one here is in any rush for anything. If you ordered food, the rotund server will sass you-even if you're a hipster like my companions were. The food is pretty enjoyable as far as Vegetarian goes. My wife enjoyed her Cheese Steak, and my Grilled Cheese was good. The Tater Tots aren't amazing like Quarry House Tavern, but if you get a sandwich, definitely add them on for $1.50. They're a bit too oily though. If you order a burger, you may not want to get the Tots though. The burger is served with the bun top off, which leaves less room on the plate, resulting in a lower Tot to Entree Ratio.Overall, it's a nice change of pace from the usual Arlington scene, but when it comes to hipsters, I'm with Channing Tatum: "I don't know what the fuck they are." (21 Jump Street)
Been going to Galaxy Hut for at least 10 years. Lots of beer and no gel-haired frat boys that seem to make up a good portion of Arlington these days. Funky art all around and the stuff on the bathroom walls will surely inspire you to slit your wrist.
It's probably a good sign that reviews for this bar seem to be split between complaints that it's too hipstersesque and not sufficiently hip. I find the atmosphere to be pleasant, and the people to be cool but not pretentious.They've got a great beer list, and a substantial all-vegetarian menu (and everything can be made vegan as a bonus). The tater tots are excellent, and while the menu is basically veg versions of normal bar food, the execution is solid nonetheless. If you're in the mood for a good beer and a nice oily vegetarian sandwich, and possibly a game of Pac-man, it doesn't get much better than galaxy hut.
I like this place. A lot. It's pretty low-key and small, but the beer selection is solid and it feels good to go to a place that is unlike the others in Clarendon. I had the Southern Tier Pumpking and was glad they had it on tap. The food looked pretty good, but I somehow fought the urge and left without eating there.Definitely a casual place to grab a drink with some friends.
One of freinds wanted to try this place and I had never heard of it. But I'm all about trying new place and things, so off we went on a Thursday night. I didn't know anything about here before I showed up. The atmosphere is cool, old video games mixed with some art on the walls. It has a great old school feel. All the table were full so we sat at the bar. Most of their beers are craft brews and they good amount of draft beers. I tried several different beers here, a pale ale, pilsner. Beers were around $5-6 pint with $1 off during happy hour. The food smelled great and everyone around us was eating the tater tots. I had to strongly resist the urge to try them.
Small and intimate, a great alternative to the typical Arlington bars. However, its getting a nasty reputation as a hipster-wannabe bar. Let me say that first off: just because you don't have a loud obnoxious bar full of frat boys, doesn't make it hipster. The bartenders are nice here and they have a good beer selection plain and simple. There are paintings on the wall, its dimly lit, and the music isn't TOP 40's music. Still, don't see problems with this, it describes many bars.Also, I LOVE that they restrict the amount of people there. I even got rejected because they said they were full, but it really does help keep the bar from getting too loud and crowded for a conversation. Nice that they're looking to protect that atmosphere.The workers aren't pretentious and you can actually hold a conversation with friends. If you want some sort of "experience" then go ahead, but I don't think this bar claims to be anything it isn't. I'm a fan.
Cover: FREE OF CHARGEBro HutI remember coming here a few years back when it was actually known as somewhat of a 'hipster' bar and enjoying a good ale while playing Pacman. To be honest I don't think Clarendon even knows what the word hipster is. Just like everything in Clarendon.. it's full of bros having brotastic bromances in space.Pros:- A great selection of beer- Cool artwork posted along the walls- Weekdays over Weekends Cons:- Bros in the patio- Bros inside- Bros in line creating the 'long line' - Bros using up the only three arcade tables and not playing anything - Bros break 1/3 of the arcade games.. crossing fingers that its not Pacman- Bros reach maximum capacity.. having other bros wait outsideIf I wanted to be in a crowded place with actual arcade games to play with a few reasonable people I can consider to be hipsters then I would rather make the trip to Atlas Arcade on H Street. Otherwise there is nothing 'hipster' about this location. I recommend coming in on a weekday to get a good feel of this establishment and enjoy the variety of beers available. If not then be prepared to battle the bros on the weekends in an epic clash to conquer the galaxy.. pew pew pew!Drinks: Fairly Priced ($$) / Variety of beersStaff: Ghosts (poof)Crowd: Bros / BruvaArcade: 3 Available / 2 Only Work
This is not a hipster bar. I did not see a single hipster last night. Do Washingtonians even know what hipsters are? Some poor soul said this was a bar straight out of Seattle's Capitol Hill. Has this person ever actually been to Seattle's Capitol Hill? This is nothing like anything thereThe beers were overpriced. It's cramped. There is absolutely no place to sit. They allow smoking on the patio. I heard there were a few arcade machines, but by arcade machines they mean a place were people sit and eat their food. You have to stand in a long line to get your beer too. We left and went to Iota instead, and our experience was a thousand times more pleasant than the one at Galaxy hut.
Dig it. Almost felt like I was back home in BK.
You know, this place isn't bad they have a great selection of beers, the bartenders are nice too but it's way too cramped and small, even on the outside. You normally can't get a table to sit at and when you do, you have people all over you because there isn't much space. Outside during nicer weather is hard to get as well. I'd come here more often probably during the week at night which is probably a better time to go but the weekends? Not so much.
This place is okay - definately not like anything else on Wilson which is a good thing. Great selection of beers. Everything was great until they called last call and as soon as they did apparently that meant you had to leave, not get one more drink. The bartender came to my table (which was connected to the bar) and said you need to finish your beer and i said okay just give me one second (since they aren't just your typical beers like bud light its not really beers to chug, more to enjoy) and he just stood there and stared waiting. A guy came up next to him and said can i close my tab and he said yes and then looked back at me - i was standing right next to the bar and i said can you close his tab and i will finish by the time you are done and he said no and literally took the beer out of my hand. While this happened my guy friend was in the restroom. As he exited the bathroom someone that worked there was waiting outside of it and immediately took his beer upon exit. Quite bizzare really.
Went on a Thursday night, wasn't really packed at all, so I guess I lucked out.Dark inside, but it's the right thing for Galaxy Hut. To me, it feels like a rock & roll speakeasy, which is pretty refreshing in the midst of Clarendon's sports grill scene. Small tables, a small bar, and genuine service is what you'll find inside. There's some unique and eclectic artwork adorning the walls as well.The beer selection is the best part. Why? Because they basically only offer craft brews on tap with the occasional macro. This weeds out the wannabes and dudebros and gives those who appreciate some craft beers a good chance to try out new flavors.I think it's cool that you can see the kitchen right behind the bar. I heard the food is not bad, so have to try that next time.Overall, GH is a place that sticks with you.
Super charming bar! Enjoy the awesome beer selection and vegan/vegetarian dining options.It is a pleasant change to many other options in the area. The place fills up quickly so be prepared if you come on a Friday night!
I don't like beer, but I like the ambiance here and I love the tater tots.
if you can get past the hipster attitude of the patrons, the beer and tater tots are well worth it!
It's a hipster spot that's not pretentious at all. I've been going there for many years (back when the current owner was just a bartender).Great selection of beers, great atmosphere, and great service. A word of warning though... it's very small. But, that's part of its charm.
Absolutely LOVED this place when we stumbled upon it one Wednesday night after my friend has checked it on Yelp.It offers A TON of different and interesting beers, so definitely be ready to try something new.The decor is kinda hipster and reminds me of good ol' Seattle, but what really made it for me was the PacMan table; it just brought back a ton of memories.Enjoy!
LOVE:1. The Vegetarian and Vegan menu2. The brew selection and knowledge of the staff3. The artwork and ambianceDislike:Hard to find a spot to sit if you show up about an hour after they open.
Absolutely phenomenal. The only reason it doesn't score 5 stars is the size, and it fills up quickly. Beer is great, food is awesome, the vibe is something you need to experience yourself.
There are several things that I really liked about Galaxy Hut. 1. The artwork. I could definitely see myself purchasing some of that artwork and decorating a room with it. 2. The scene. I went to see a friend's band play, and I liked how intimate the venue was. You really felt like you were participating in the fun of the band, and that you were part of a local community music scene. It's a rare feat to feel that way in the DC area. 3. The people. I thought this would be a hipster paradise, but it's DC of course. So, it brought a really eclectic crowd of all sorts of backgrounds, types, ages, styles, etc.. I liked that it was diverse, and that you didn't have to be pigeonholed into anything to enjoy your experience there. The only negative is that there isn't much seating, it's a very tiny place. So, the same thing that makes it very intimate can also e construed as very crowded at times.
Kind of a nerd bar, if there is such a thing. Not the worst place, but as anyone living in Claredon knows, this ain't NYC or SF or georgetown with tons of good places to go to.
galaxy hut is a pretty rad place.the first time i was taken here i was told that i would really dig it because it was quirky and kitschy. quirky, yes; kitschy, not really. it seems a lot of other people refer to it as a dive but it definitely isnt that. to say someplace is a dive usually insinuates that it is a shithole, at least by my definition. often this is because the owner doesnt give a shit about appearances. there is all sorts of cool pop-culture-esque art on the walls. some of the tables are old arcade games. (which for some reason nobody ever seems to play.) there is a tv above the bar, which last time i was there was playing some old-timey black and white movie. im not sure what it was, or if they do that often. my point is that this place has a very obviously deliberate appearance. in fact, last time i was there my buddy pointed out the painted ceiling tiles which he claimed must have taken ages to do, stating that he once had a first hand experience painting ceiling tiles. regardless, he was impressed.dont get me wrong though, im not complaining about the effort put into the place. i actually really appreciate all of those things. i think i just disagree with those who use the word "divey" to describe it. its just a cool place that to me feels casual and relaxed.ive been told there is a patio in the back but i have yet to see it, which is a bummer because the bar itself is miniscule. often there are no seats available and people must resign to standing. on one occasion i almost got turned down at the door because they were so close to capacity.as for food and beverages, well the beverages at least, i cant really speak for the food. ive never eaten here but the food always looks and smells amazing, and ive heard that the mac and cheese is particularly good. the beer selection though is all around stellar. mostly dark and heavy; browns, porters, and stouts. a few ipas, and a lager or two. i think youd be hard pressed to find a light beer here, i dont remember if they actually server them or not.thats about all, i think. go check the place out, i doubt youll have a bad time.
Anyone who says this is a dive has probably never been to a dive bar before. Or they're just a hipster. Because this is a hipster bar. Not necessarily a bad thing, but no dive bar would put in the money that this place does to constantly rotate their existential paintings that stole the characters from Zoloft commercials. Actually, they reminded me much more of my favorite evil dubstep kitty - youtube.com/watch?v=DbCY .In short, they have a great beer selection and it's a nice low-key bar. It's a very cozy bar, in kind of an artificial way. It's good when not busy.The first time I was here I quickly jet after one beer. It's a good thing I generally don't review after one visit, because I would have rocked them. Friday night around 9pm the place was swarmed and there were no seats available. This isn't the sort of place where an open area is an invitation for standing conversation. In fact, quite the opposite. One frustrating aspect in practice is that they only have one cash register and bartender. In doing so, the line to grab a beer extends however long the place is thirsty. In my case, about twenty beers were in line ahead of me. Sticking around for another beer simply wasn't an option and we quickly walked out with no intentions of returning.My second visit I went with a larger group and we really dug into the beer list. It's diverse and affordably priced. The people are cool and the drinks are good. Really no complaints, if there's room to sit.
A fun place to go if you like to try new and unique beer. However the venue is very very tiny. It reminds me of a dive bar you'd find in Brooklyn, NY. The only reason I didn't rate them higher is because the beer is very pricey - which is fine if the service is great. But they poured 2 of us the wrong drink, once we took a sip we realized it was incorrect. We asked them for the correct beer, and they charged us for both beers - the incorrect one in which they threw away and the correct one that we drank. I thought that was pretty poor customer service. They would not take back the charge.
I don't really have anything much to add as everyone seems to have summed up my feelings on the place quite well. Good vibe, great beer selection, friendly people, excellent menu with lots of vegetarian options. Great patio for nicer weather. Yeah, it's small and the parking can be a pain, but it's totally worth it.
Great little dive bar in Arlington with a large selection of beers. Minimal seating indoors, but when it's nice outside, I'd recommend sitting outside in the back alley. Kinda has a wannabe hipster feel to it, but I'll take it over Whitlows any day!
Ah Galaxy Hut. Many a forgotten night ended here. It's a dive. It's a smelly hippie haven for terrible human beings, but I still like the place. The ambiance is relaxed and the beer selection, though small, focuses on nice brews that will appeal to people of ill repute.So what's not to love?Well, everyone makes the same complaint, but I will voice my concern as well: space. It's teeny, tiny. There's some room up front, and a few tables in the narrow stretch on the side. When first I went, there was a space in the back, which has since been closed off. This was most unfortunate. I have tried valiantly to take visiting guests and dates to this dive with the hopes of securing a table (or at least a few seats). So far, I think I am batting....186. Below the Mendoza Line. This will never do.UPDATE: Batting average has improved. I'm not at .500 yet, but I think I am in Tony Gwynn territory.
A little slice of Seattle's Capitol Hill in Arlington! What more could a PNW transplant ask for? Great beers and quirky hipster decor.
The beer selection is ever changing and really great, the atmosphere is awesome, and the fact that they have old arcade games as tables seals the deal: this place is legit. Definitely not a dive-bar, as I've seen it described in some reviews, but it is small and often crowded. Once you're inside, you'll know why.
Very cool little spot. I met some friends here for happy hour after finding the place through yelp. Drafts were $1 off and there was a robust beer selection. We went on a Wednesday and the place was full but not crowded. We were able to get seats and we could hear each other talk without screaming. I can't help thinking this would be a good place to take a blind date. If things don't go well at least you can share some delicious tater tots while avoiding eye contact amid awkward silence.
Awesome selection of tasty beers and a trendy, dive bar type atmosphere in an area where you would least expect it. This is my favorite spot in Clarendon so far. My only complaint is that there was very little seating. My date and I stood for quite some time until we were able to snag two stools.
Fun little dive bar. Great beer selection! Very small bar. They'll post a sign on the door if its too crowded. Tip! If you sit at the bar, you'll get priority treatment from the bartenders.
Great dive bar with good beer selection, greasy food, and ample hipster patronage to roll your eyes at. Come on an off-night for the best experience.
This is a fun, hip place. The tables are video games. There is a Jukebox. The decor is full of cartoons and funky stuff. They have a good beer selection and good hot dogs. There can be a line for the bar, but it is very orderly and moves quickly. it is a small place and it gets crowded. Also, they don't serve liquor.
Awesome little dive bar on Wilson Blvd. that has a great selection of craft beers rotated out, and a good selection of food to include tater tots and alot of vegetarian dishes. I went here with a friend to meet up for dinner/happy hour and was pleasantly surprised by this little place. It has local paintings up on the walls, even if they are a bit morbid. There are tables made of old video games, and did I mention that have tater tots!?! There is an outside patio, too, but I did not check that out. This seems like a great place to meet up for a drink or casual get-together. Worked perfectly for us.
**update 11/15/11 - Shortly after I posted my review, the owner of Galaxy Hut reached out to me in an incredibly positive and encouraging way. I just had the opportunity to revisit Galaxy Hut this evening and enjoyed a completely different experience from my original review, with the same bartender, which made things even more awesome. My friend and I had a great evening of conversation and delicious beer, delivered in a fast and friendly way. Thank you, Galaxy Hut staff and management -- I'll be back.----+1 star for awesome, awesome beer (served properly, as other reviewers note).-4 stars for lousy, surly, unpleasant and unprofessional service.I really, really want to like Galaxy Hut. But as long as the bartender with the shaved head and mutton chop sideburns is there, I'll be staying away. Does anyone know his schedule? I'll happily return when he's not working.Last night, my girlfriend and I visited Galaxy Hut. We were both fully aware of what Galaxy Hut is and is not and were simply looking to have a quick drink of delicious beer together. We were wearing t-shirts, hoodies and jeans - not at all dressed like the typical Clarendon crowd. So I was very surprised to be treated like a mega frat dude who just stumbled out of Spider Kelly's. Well aware that Galaxy Hut is self-service unless you're sitting at the bar, I proceeded directly to the giant arrow by the register to place my order. Fortunately, things weren't busy - there were a couple open tables and seats at the bar, and I was first in line.The bartender was 8 feet away, talking with another employee. He saw me and didn't give any acknowledgement, but I simply stood waiting. I don't have unreasonable service expectations, especially here, and I didn't expect him to come dashing over instantly. But I kept waiting. And waiting. After a couple minutes, he finished talking and I thought he'd come take my order. He first stopped to check in with a couple of patrons seated at the bar. That's fine, whatever, they've been sitting there and might be regulars. He finished with them and finally came over to me. "Hello," I said. No response. I may not be a regular, but shouldn't you at least say hi back to a customer? Even in the surliest of dive bars, politeness reciprocates politeness. I order: "I'll have two pints, White Rascal and Bourbon Barrel Stout, please." I glance around, then turn my attention back to the bar. The bartender's put two pints of a light-colored wheat beer in front of me and about to start pouring a stout when I ask, "Uhh, which one's which?" He stopped and stared. "You said you wanted two pints of White Rascal and two pints of Bourbon Barrel Stout." Uh oh. I respond, "I'm sorry, I said two pints - one of each." He sighed loudly and took one away, setting it down roughly on the bar behind him. He finished silently pouring the stout and then said, "That'll be $14." Normally at a bar, I'll tip $1-2 a beer. But after having to wait (and wait and wait) without any acknowledgement, recognition or reciprocal greeting, I'm not feeling inclined to tip a whole lot. Then, when a bartender acts surly and unprofessional about his error - or at best, a miscommunication between an otherwise friendly customer - the tip's off the table completely and I start contemplating a three star Yelp review. When he asked if I'd like to keep the tab open or closed, I told him, "close it, please." He gave me the bill and I wrote a dash through the tip line, then took a copy of the receipt with me. (Always, always do that!) That's when his tantrum began and the prospective review quickly dropped to one star."Thanks a lot, I really appreciate that," he said snarkily. I didn't respond and started to walk away. The bartender slammed the cash drawer shut and said, "Goddamn it!" He muttered a few more things to nearby customers and proceeded to throw angry glares our way until I stopped even looking in the direction of the bar.Why the hell would he act so unprofessional and immature over losing out on $2 because of his own lousy attitude? I kept my testosterone in check and resisted the urge to tell him exactly why he didn't receive a tip., feeling totally vindicated for leaving $0. Luckily, the beer was absolutely delicious and my girlfriend and I had great conversation tucked away in the corner. We lingered for 30 minutes and then left once we'd finished our drinks. As I mentioned in the beginning, although Galaxy Hut's beer selection is amazing... we'll be staying away as long as mutton chop man is behind the bar. Lyon Hall and Iota have a similarly great selection with (usually) awesome service. Other delicious beer destinations include Fireworks and Restaurant 3, not to mention some of the larger establishments. I want to support independent, creative, unique small businesses -- but I won't do it when their service is so lousy.
Galaxy Hut is cool without being obnoxious. It's more the type of place I'd go to if it were in the East Village or the Lower East Side, but I'll settle for this location in Northern Virginia. The bartender seemed to be a master at the taps, like waiting for the percussion drummer at the symphony (not slow, but good at what he does). Remember to order where the arrow is pointing if you aren't sitting at the bar. Drunk girl was convinced I was drinking Smithwicks and bitching up a storm about her beer tasting like shit (I was drinking something else).There were a couple of dicks that were 86'd out of the place while we were in here (couldn't figure out what for) and a couple of hot broads sitting at the bar next to us that I thought were going to leave with us but they left with someone else -such is life.
Great spot to throw back a few beers. Nothing super special. Good selection of beers and interesting paintings on the wall. I was driving through the DC metro area and my fiends decided we meet here. All in all a good place to hang.
It may appear like a dive bar, but though it has the charming qualities of one, it offers great beer options and a bartender who is very friendly. Also the back is very relaxing to sit out in during the summer. Not too loud, but still very social.
This place has such an awesome decor. The tables in the back are old video games that you can actually play! Food and drink are cheap, and since I'm a fan of classic hot dogs, this place did my stomach well. My friend played an acoustic set here and it was a lot of fun. The crowd was really into the music and not talking over it. Seems like you come there spefically for the music and atmosphere. Bar staff was friendly and very quick service, while still being laid back and chill.
Yay! Finally a place my boyfriend likes and will go to without complaining! This place is so laid back it is almost astonishing. Maybe that's just Dupont talking...not sure. Good beer, cool atmosphere. Great place to go just to converse with friends. Go early, around 9, if you want a table because it is smalllll.
As many have emphasized, this place is tiny, but my Irish luck must run toward beer because I always manage to score a seat when I go to the Hut.I go here for many of the reasons people pick on this place. I don't mind the business-like attitude of the bartender. He always directs me to a good beer suggestion and knows his stuff if you have a question. Really, the place is so small that table service would be a bit much. The hipsters keep out the white hat/plaid shorts/addidas flip flops set, and they are so self absorbed that they won't annoy me with their hipster antics either. It is an all-around good situation for someone who wants to go to a bar with their friends and drink good beer. Not for the crowd who is out to meet someone "special" on a Saturday night.I do wish they sold shot glass tastes of the beers. I have been adventurous and ordered some strange things in the past that I wish I could have tasted first.
Met some friend here on a Friday night. Wasn't much of a wait to get inside but they do keep a limit as the place is super tiny with only about 10 tables and a side bar. We had to queue in line to the bar to get drinks, no waitresses but it wasn't too long of a wait. Very cool art on the wall by a local artist (I have forgotten the name already). Any place that has tater tots on the menu is A-OK in my book.My friends new favorite bar!
I like this place, and have since I moved here in 2006. It's hipster, but not over the top hipster. It's a dive bar, but serves top shelf beer, in the right glasses to boot. Evidence suggests it may well be a gay bar, but I really only go here to play PacMan. PacMan table? Pinball tables?Yes indeed. Automatic 5 stars.
Upon entering, I was worried that this sausage party was a bit too hipster for my tastes: those Little Italy lights in the front window, the biff-bang-pow painted ceilings, tabletop 80s arcade games, Garanimals-inspired wall art, and tons of horn-rimmed glasses.I was surprised, however, at both how good the beer was, how attentive the bartender was, and (dare I say) how hip patrons were. The smallish interior seats maybe 40 people. Bands play Sundays and Mondays, and if you'd rather not pay the nominal cover you're welcome to drink yourself silly on the veranda.While I would not call it cheap, drinks were in the realm of reason. One minor complaint is that the bar stools made me wanting for a booster seat: either the bar is too tall, the stools are too low, or my torso is too short.Something between between a dive bar and LA's Hotel Cafe, in Clarendon this place is second only to Jay's Saloon & Grille. Maybe it's me that's the hipster.
This place is definitely for a certain crowd... not my kind of crowd.
You certainly don't come here to impress, you come here for the beer and quirky atmosphere. And maybe the bar food, which is pretty decent. Particularly the tots. Love the tots. But, I will have to say, as a gentleman, you'll take one look around the place and realize, all dudes. Also, they take their maximum capacity allowed quite seriously, which results in painful waits as early as 9pm. So get there early if you want to come in.
I like places that let you feel like you're at home. Obviously, I'm talking within reason, not "Al put your hand down your pants Bundy" type of home, but instead if you mind your manners you can pretty much do what you want. An example of this is that one time an associate and myself set up shop there with a chess board and had a few beers, along with dinner. While Galaxy Hut isn't always conducive for such things as it gets crowded on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday evenings, when it's not it's a great place to do so.Their menu is cheap but yet at the same time really good, I've had the burger and the grilled chicken sandwich there and both were quality items that I'd have again. Sure, they have fries too, but they also have tots, and I love tots. I'm sure you love tots too, if you don't.. then you must be.. A TERRORIST!!  but i digress...Another positive about this spot would be the the other customers, some places you go, like certain coffee shops, where the people are uptight and don't want to be bothered. At Galaxy hut though the vibe is relaxed and very casual to where jiving with random folks isn't all that uncommon.Overall, it's a great spot and one I don't get back to nearly enough.
Love this tiny place. Fabulous craft beer selection (tap, bottles, cans). Solid bar food. Pacman. Chill vibes, decked out in art by the guy who does Dirt Farm - bendependent.com
To me, Galaxy was like the latest X-men movie: I went high on the expectations set forth by reviews from friends and online. When I finally went, I enjoyed myself, but wasn't quite sure it was worth all the hype. The beer selection was great, there is no denying it. And the fact that you can get pitchers of quality beer was definitely a plus. However, the price reflected as much. I'm pretty sure a pitcher of Lagunitas set us back $26. Still, I wasn't too upset for the price hike as long as I don't have to choke down another pitcher of Miller Lite. The bar is small and personal, I can see why locals would love it. I bet if I lived down the street, I would make that my hangout. But that did make me feel a bit like an interloper. I also wasn't able to get one of the arcade tables that had drawn my attention, but I had guessed those would be a hot commodity.
My drinking partner (and wife!) and I stopped by here this evening, for a quick beer. We've passed this place many times since moving into Arlington, and it's always been jammed. Today, we were in there before 8P, so there were actually open tables to sit at. We walked up to the bar, and the guy who was serving was very helpful, and his beer recommendation was spot on, for what I was looking for (something dark, but not a stout). We relaxed with some good music and atmosphere, so I can see why people like hanging out here. I noticed one guy who was acting as quasi-bouncer, and he had his face buried in his smartphone, which is how we managed to get past him and not get carded. Another couple did too, and then he came running up behind them to ask for i.d.'s. On the way out I said thank you to him, and he just barely grunted...real nice. I guess we don't fit the hipster poseur mold, so screw him. We'll go back again at some point, after we check out the dozens of other places along the Ballston-Rosslyn corridor that have a good selection of beer on tap.
So sad. I'm not the type of guy who usually prattles on about how cool a place "used to be" but this joint takes the cake. Five to ten years ago, back when the old owner (I think her name was Alice) had the place this was a nice, unassuming, friendly but relaxed place to get an unusual microbrew, have a great conversation with the person sitting next to you or the bartender, and watch some up and coming garage band rolling through town. It was never cheap but it was almost always a good time. As much as I like Lary and as good a bartender as he is, the place has gone downhill for years since he bought it. Yes, it's packed most nights and I'm happy that he seems to be doing well with the place but the servers and clientele are now some of the most hideously rude, obnoxious, pretentious, wannabe poseurs you'll ever have the misfortune of sharing space with. It's like they came from that infamous Youtube video "Being a D*ckhead's Cool" (youtube.com/watch?v=Xzoc). The cramped layout, charming and intimate years ago, now just emphasizes these attributes all the more. It's Arlington and the DC area at its worst. Unfortunately, most places in Clarendon more or less fit that description now but this place used to be better than that.
Used to go to this place all the time in high school. Went back again and not much has changed. Still a great place to see live music and hang out
I should first start out by saying that I can't write an objective review of Galaxy Hut - it is my local bar (even though I live in Mount Pleasant), it is home-away-from-home, and it is basically family to me.I know all the staff, and the owner...and the previous owner, and I call them all friends, so take this with a grain of salt:I guess I've waited so long to write a Galaxy Hut review because I like to keep my hidden gems hidden...but sadly, I'm lying to myself if I say it is hidden. So may as well help bring in the right crowd, and point the rest of the people down to Whitlows where they belong!Galaxy Hut is a place you go to in order to see your good friends, to catch up and have a great pint of beer. No, they don't have hard liquor anymore....it's been years, and while I love my bourbon, I'm fine with this place just being decent bar food and beer....and good music.The beer selection is great, the live music may be a bit on the decline, but it is great as well, and the regulars are awesome. Is it a bit of a hipster crowd...these days, maybe. But since part of being a hipster is denying the culture we'll never really know.Come here for good beer, good conversation, and friends that you will have for a lifetime.Oh, and if you are part of the post-frat, post-sorority crowd, check out Whitlow's reviews on Yelp instead!
My favorite bar. Great beer selection, reasonable prices. There's decent music but it's not so loud that you can't carry on a conversation, and the outdoor space is nice as well. I'm looking forward to when they are able to increase their capacity.
I can't believe I've lived in the area for 4 years and never been here until this past weekend. I really enjoyed the laid back vibe. It does have an artsy feel to it that seems out of place for Clarendon, but I like it. It reminds me of places in the East Village in New York. The microbrewed beer selection is really what steals the show. They have a rotating selection of well chosen beers ranging in style, including some really "big" beers and ciders. They also give the option to buy pints, goblets or pitchers of anything, or you can put together your own "flight" and get 4 oz glasses for 1/3 of the cost of a goblet. Tater tots of course, as others have mentioned, are a great side. They have vegetarian options and are flexible about accommodating requests for other diets as well.
If you want a place to hang out and give a couple of new beers a try, this is it.
I love this bar, come as you are. And drink a Sofia Coppola Champagne Sippy Cup!
Excellent small restaurant with great vibe and AWESOME food. Beer selection is a big plus!
What a fun little place! Emphasize on the LITTLE. SMALL! TINY! I would have stood the whole night if it weren't for a nice gentleman who was stalking the ladies at the bar and told me they were leaving soon. So I hovered over them and the second they left, stole the bar stools. I'm sure that some people there never sat down, but it was ok, everyone was having a great time! This is the place to go if you enjoy karaoke and want to sing whatever you want! I didn't hear just the typical karaoke bar songs, there was everything from Weird Al to Jewel to Show Tunes. To add to the eclectic style of this little (did I say that already?) bar are the variety of beers (I hear the switch them out often) and the fun and crazy paintings on the walls from local artists! I have no idea what was playing on the TV throughout the night, sometimes it was some crazy ballet and at one point it was tennis, but in black and white.All said and done: Fun. Eclectic. Little (but I said that already).
Galaxy Hut: weird crowd, great beers, eclectic atmosphere. Overall I actually really like it. They have some good, well-priced ciders, and I love the Rasputin beer. I actually like the way they handle bar crowds, forming a line to take your order instead of simply hoarding around the bar like most places. Even though the line gets long, this way is much more orderly and you can always stand with your friends in the line and chat.As I said, kind of a weird crowd comes here, and its amusing to overhear conversations going on at other tables (battlestar galaxy, pokemon, world of warcraft) and people-watch. I like how some of the tables are old school pacman arcade games, though it is hard to get a table as it gets pretty crowded.In all, this is a good, unusual place, that I recommend going to at least once just to take in the atmosphere and have some good beers!
dear galaxy hut,i love you forever. don't ever change. seriously, don't. the new seating expansion being the only acceptable thing.fantastic beer selection. i have something new and awesome every time. i love love love the ipod always playing overhead, fantastic taste. yes, there are hipsters but it's not over run with the particularly annoying kind, people here are pretty chill and not overly rude.and, there are tots! how could one say no to that?
First off, I am pretty impressed with myself for breaking my "No Arlington" rule (I'm lazy and Arlington has never really appealed to me) to come here. This is a cool quirky tiny place. I thought the cartoons all of the walls were awesome and they even had Pacman and pinball (I think?).They don't serve liquor but they do have a pretty nice beer selection. From what I gather, you can get any beer in a goblet, pint or pitcher. I got a $7 pint of Double Brown Ale and by the time I was halfway through, I was already feeling it. That's what I call a solid deal.I probably won't be here too often, as I still don't like to go into Arlington, but if I am in the area, this will definitely be my first/only stop
This is the best bar in the DC metro area, bar none. Great vibe, great artwork, high prices but hey this is Arlington. I've never been to a bar in the United States where you can come back a week after your last visit and look at a list of at least ten new beers on draught. If you like dark beer, you've found your mecca - there's three to four new dark beers on tap every week, if not more. Porters and stouts rule here. Despite what I've read from other yelp reviewers, I've never found the staff to be anything but accommodating and friendly in my many, many visits. Great music selection, too. If only they'd get a reliable list of their live music acts on their website or facebook, and turn on the jukebox once in a while, this would be the best bar of all time.
I absolutely dread every time my co workers want to come here for happy hour. Yes it has a good beer selection (and cider for me, since I prefer a Natural Light over any good beer any day), but the staff is NOT FRIENDLY. I feel like I'm intruding on their lives by ordering beer and a hot dog. They even make you stand at one place at the bar, I guess to ensure you're being served in the order you come to the bar, so that should take a little stress off the bartenders. But no, still rude. Maybe it's a hipster thing to not smile and be nice to customers. Who knows.That being said, food isn't tooooo bad. Tatertots are the best thing on their menu, and really, with an industrial deep fryer, how can you mess those up? I guess eating your tots while playing PacMan is cool. But it's just not worth it to me to go to such a small place that should have a cool, friendly atmosphere to have someone roll their eyes at you for asking for two hot dogs with different things on each. I mean really, I know it might take you an extra 3 seconds to turn to the guy 6 feet away in the kitchen to ask that one has no sauerkraut, but I think you can handle it. And it's not like they're good hot dogs. When hotdogs are served to adults NOT out of a food cart, I expect them not to be the kind you buy in 12 packs from oscar meyer. The little nook/hut in the back yard is nice in the summer, but not worth it.
Great divey bar with an amazing beer selection. And who could possibly hate a place that serves premium beers in a pitcher (ie Delirium in a pitcher = awesome!). And since the smoking ban in VA started, it's a lot better atmosphere inside. A great bar that is unlike any others in Arlington.
In a galaxy not so near to me is a place where I can sip some wine, play Pac-Man, and pretend like I'm the coolest kid on the block. The atmosphere is out of this world. Don't miss the tiny walk-way/alley that holds some very interesting seating areas... I missed it on my 1st trip.
Oh my God. New favourite bar for the following reasons:This place is small, it's dark, and it's weird. There are video game tables and dim lighting and hipsters, and I absolutely love it. This bar reminds me of every drinking establishment I've fallen in love with in Richmond, VA. It's the type of bar I thought I'd have to give up when I chose to go to school in NoVA, but here it is right down the street from where I work in Arlington.I came in here last week with an old friend of mine. I practically had to drag him because he's the polo-shirt-wearing-khaki-pants-sporting variety of Alexandrian. (Miraculously, he isn't a douchebag.). He actually ended up liking it too. We ordered a couple of beers from the revolving door of selections at Galaxy. I had originally come in with the intent of getting whatever kind of bourbon stout they were offering, but instead I was convinced by the (rather aloof, it has to be stated) bartender that the only thing they had resembling my preference was some kind of chocolate stout thing. I will mention here that when I heard this I thought that chocolate and beer, while delicious separately, should NEVER be mixed together. However, I was pleasantly surprised by how damn good it was. I think it was called Heavy Seas Siren Noire Stout. I had two of them. This, I will note, was enough to leave me pleasantly tipsy. If I can drink only two beers to feel nice, and therefore pay for only two beers to feel nice, that is perfectly all right with me.I'm going to become a regular here whether they want me to or not. Also, apparently there's some sort of patio through a mysterious door that looked to me at first like it might lead to the men's room, so I obviously have to try that out. If you're tired of the frat-boy-Northface-girl bars in Arlington serving shitty brews, check out this tiny place on Wilson. You won't be disappointed.
Very small! So watch out or you may have to wait for seating!Review the menu and then go up to the bar to order both drinks and food. Had the chilidogs with tator tots that it's known for... the dog wasn't that spectacular. Kind of mushy. But it was good with the great beer selection. Will come back for the beer.
I have five words for you: corn dogs with tater tots! Order these and they come with a delicious honey mustard sauce (and the tots are always piping hot). They also have a great selection of beer... usually with a high alcohol content. It's a great dive bar and easy to get to.Cheers,
The only bar worth going to in Clarendon and perhaps all of Arlington. This is assuming you like excellent beer and don't need to be around 21-23 year olds with bleached blond hair.
Great atmosphere and great beers. It's small, and the wait can be long to get a beer, but it's worth it. They have a large selection of delicious beer to choose from. They have a jukebox, normally good music playing, and live music sometimes.They also have video game tables which I have not been lucky enough to experience. Definitely one of my favorite places in Clarendon.
This is one of the only bars in Clarendon that you don't have to worry about a bunch of frat boys in brown flip-flops spilling Miller Lite on you while dancing to Ke$ha. It's considered a "hipster" bar by many in the area but is a nice break from the Clarendon scene.I go there at least once a week for three things: beer, bacon cheese dogs (BEST EVER!), and atmosphere. It's not a very social bar, you can just grab a table in a corner, eat your tots and actually carry on a conversation with your friends without shouting over a DJ. The only reason it is 4 stars and not 5 is that you have to wait in line for a drink if you're not at the bar. I suggest ordering a pitcher and splitting it with your friends.
Walking from Courthouse, this bar is kind of hard to miss and I'm grateful! Walking in i knew I was in a different kind of place. One word: "Hipster".Charmingly hipster though. You won't get uncomfortable looks, don't worry. My friends and I sat at the bar and we were served immediately. It is interesting to note that all of the serving staff have that late 20 something scraggle beards. The place is decorated to look like an indie comic strip with colorful pictures and fixtures.Only beer and munchies here. The selection is good with lots of craft beers and the food ranges from $5 to $10. Tots are a featured item apparently, but we didn't try any.There's no table service here unless you sit at the bar. What I thought was nice is that they have a designated line for people ordering drinks. I hate grinding up against people and waving 20's to get bar service and this place somewhat alleviates this problem.Overall, a great neighborhood bar with the exception that it's not very big.
I'm so conflicted about this place. The beer on tap selection is fantastic and they have some great Belgian brews that are hard to find elsewhere. I decor is "interesting"... There is weird, funky art (think Homestar Runner) on the walls and a couple tables that double as old-school arcade machines. The dude-chick ratio is probably pushing 2-1 on most nights and this place attracts the type of person who would be drawn to a place called "Galaxy Hut." If you'd like a solid example of this, read Khalib B.'s review; this will help you understand exactly what I'm talking about. Either way though, it is a good place to just come with a couple friends and relax while sipping some great beers.
This "dive like establishment" located in the heart of Clarendon is the only redeeming factor of this neighborhood. That is, it's the only reason I ever venture out of the District and into Arlington to drink/socialize. Last night I went there for the second time after a performance at the Artisphere near Rosslyn. Luckily I had friends with a car or I wouldn't have wasted the energy. It wasn't as busy as the last time I was there and we were able to get a seat at the bar. Don't fall for the cool booths with the Pac-man games - if you sit at a table you have to go WAIT in a LINE to get your beer from the ONE bartender. Like a bunch of frat kids waiting in line for the keg. HOWEVER if you sit at the bar you get bar service. They serve only beer (no liquor) and self-serve water, oh and food - people are Tot-Crazy here, and they taste just like Ore-Irda (no one beats ChurchKey's homemade tots), but, are a fun treat late at night. They also have this hot dog - the only time I'll EVER eat a hot dog outside of a baseball game - it's split in half on a grilled bun with cheese and bacon on it. Lord it's delicious, and *very* healthy.The beer selection is good and if you sit at the bar you can usually get a sample. This place gets VERY packed with the "hipsters of Arlington" on the weekends and people get a little to close for comfort, but, most of them are generally friendly and it seems to be the only tolerable place to check out slightly attractive people - primarily if you're into guys with beards, in the neighborhood.
Word. I agree with the review that says this reminds a girl of a neighborhood bar back in Seattle. Simple, grungy atmosphere, delicious beers, laid-back and knowledgeable bartenders. Asked the cool chick working the bar which porter she preferred. She not only could state a preference but also tell me what they would taste like! Got a yummy bourbon-barrel, chocolaty porter from Kentucky.Go here if you like beers, want to avoid getting hit on by jarheads in pink collared shirts, and are ready to settle in for a session and some good conversation with your neighbor. Nice place to relax after work.
Some of the best beer options (especially on tap) in DC in an otherwise awesome bar. The music is great normally and a few days of the week you can catch live music for a small cover. They have a lot of great artwork and some pretty decent bar food.If you can get a seat at one of the video game tables, you're set.
This is my favorite bar in Arlington, hands down. They have a ton of great beer options, the bartenders are super down to earth and really friendly, and there is the least amount of douchebaggery going on here until you reach DC. The art work in the place is funky, yet unique. Almost reminds me of the Gorillaz music videos. They have old school video games that double as tables, the patio is an awesome place to be on nice nights, and you are guaranteed to see a great mix of people. If you are looking for a chill, hole in the wall place to grab a beer, talk with some friends, and not be bothered with the typical Arlington crowd, this is definitely the place to be.
Not sure if we were supposed to park where we did but oh well... AT&T didn't need those spaces so late at night. Personally I prefer to camp my wheels in the residential neighborhood behind GH. BBQ pork sandwich came with a pickle and fries, guiding Hyunoo to get his own order of fries even though we totally couldn't finish them. Bell's Oberon was excellent, and I was enticed by the rest of the small but pleasing selection. Arcade games were not for us, but we gladly took over the Pacman table when it cleared out; hunching at the end of the bar was getting old. Bartender is awesome. Paying cover for crappy music sucked, yet the humor of wincing at a band called The Potentials didn't elude me. I'll definitely be back, hopefully on a night where not so many people are packed into such a tiny space.
Want to get away from the frat boys and girls that roam around Clarendon? This is the place to go. I normally hate crowds but there's something about entering into Galaxy Hut and heading straight towards the cluster of people that are waiting in line to order a pint. People are never rude or pushy to the front and everyone is laid back and grungy. it's as if I'm back in Seattle. Selection on tap is large (although a little too many IPAs for my taste) and the music is almost always good. It's hard to get a seat and standing in the small space can be awkward but wait long enough and you might get a seat playing pacman or some awesome old pinball machine.
In a neighborhood increasingly being overrun with douchbaggery, Galaxy Hut is a diamond in the rough. This cozy bar offers standard bar snacks, a great juke box, some old school arcade games and a stellar choice of beer. They do not sell liquor, so beer and wine are their bread and butter. This place is always a go to for great conversation with friends while sampling beers from all over the country/world.One of my favorite samplings at this place was the Founders Cherry Cerise. Good God that was an excellent beer. The beer menu is constantly changing so I suggest following them on Facebook/Twitter.
Great minds think alike. All those who agreed that this would be an awesome neighborhood hangout if we lived in Clarendon. It turned out the wonderful peeps who attended the smoked-sous vide fried chicken social were all regulars at Galaxy Hut, including our talented home Chef C. Nobody is cooler than Chef C. After we were treated a wholesome southern style fried chicken dinner with EVERYTHING made from scratch including the smoked bacon in the slowly stewed collard greens, macaroni/cheese, homemade biscuits and fried chicken that was smoked for 45 min/sous vide for 1 hr and dregged in buttermilk and flour then deep fried. The most moist fried chicken I ever had, hands down. We even had freshly made macarons from yet another talented baker. It was almost like a cooking secret society!! After the fantastic dinner, we headed to their favorite bar. Since it was the first Sunday of the month it was Kareoke night at Galaxy Hut. This was not the asian kareoke setup, it was one with the stage area where people had to sing in front of the entire bar. Everyone knew everyone - how awesome was that? There were some very talented singers amongst the kareoke enthusiasts. I enjoyed and laughed through the night with delicious Dogfish punkin ale in my hand.
You could walk past Galaxy Hut and never know it was there. It's the epitome of a "hole in the wall" bar. However, inside you're greeted with pinball machines, booths, a small bar, outdoor seating, and a PHENOMENAL beer list . The Hut holds a special place in my heart because it's where I met my husband, however, I'm sure I'd still probably find it pretty awesome either way. The ambiance is playful and the decor is erh... "unique". The main seating area boasts several large booths and tables, with a smaller bar that you can sit at as well. There's an outdoor area that's pretty much a closed in alley-way, yet somehow they make it work with a spaceship-like booth in the back and smaller tables lining the skinnier bits. The people that go here are as eclectic as the decor and not a yuppie in sight (which is quite something considering this place is located in Clarendon). The food's pretty typical bar food, but to be honest, you don't come here for the food, you come for the awesome selection of beers on tap, the music, and the people. This is the place to go if you want to remove yourself from the cheesy Clarendon bar scene and just grab a great brew and chat with friends over good tunes.
Love, love, love Galaxy Hut for being the most "chill" bar in this area - plus great selection of beer! I love the fact that there are no servers constantly bothering you. If you want a beer you go and get one from the bar. The long lines move pretty fast and the bartenders are super friendly and quick. The selection of beer is fantastic and constantly rotating. Got a pitcher of Victory Golden Monkey since I can hardly ever find it on tap anywhere else! Prices are decent too - $28 for a pitcher (that's about 5-6 glasses so you're definitely saving money if you buy in packs). They also had a few pumpkin ales on tap for Fall. The patio is great for crowds that want to get a little louder, plus the weather is still nice enough to sit outside and enjoy drinks. 5 stars for the tater tots! They were hot, crunchy and perfect to snack on while drinking. This has become one of my favorite bars and since it's so close to IOTA you can grab drinks before a show.
A long time ago in a galaxy [hut] far, far away          BAR         TOURS        Episode VI RETURN OF THE DRUNK GUY   Luke Beerdrinker has returned to   his home city of Arlington in   an attempt to rescue his   friend Drunk Solo from the   clutches of the vile barskank   Blabla the Gut.   Little does Luke know that the   Galactic Bartender has secretly   begun construction on a new   alcoholic beverage even   more powerful than the first   dreaded Death Pour.   When completed, this ultimate   weapon will spell certain doom   for the small band of brain cells   struggling to restore sobriety  to the galaxy.... Yeah, that kind of sucked but good gosh darn it Galaxy Hut does not! With 20 beers on tap, at least 3 of which are strong enough to make a grown man regret his choices, and even more in bottles; The selection in this small bar is excellent in both taste and power. Giving you a choice in sizes between 4 oz samples to large glass pitchers you can be as exploratory or committal as your little heart desires. Add some tots to the mix, enjoy some local musical talent, play a desktop arcade game, and take in the comical wall art to make it a nice chill evening with the homies. If the weather's nice try outside and if some girl asks if you are some other girl's boyfriend you say "No, but I could be yours". Stay spacey my friends.
You know, I am not happy to write this review. After two years of wanting to check out Galaxy Hut, I finally did. And while I would give them 4 stars for the beer selection, and 4 stars for the bartender, it's actually the food I went for. Yes, I was enticed by the hot dogs cooked in IPA with sauerkraut. Maybe it's because I grew up loving Stewarts Rootbeer in NJ with their hotdogs with sauerkraut. But nonetheless, we went and I ordered the hotdogs and tater tots and my boyfriend ordered the burger. The hotdogs were decent, but the kicker for me was the cold sauerkraut that I could just not get over. The tots were tasty, but the hotdog were just ok (although I bet if the kraut was even slightly warm the meal would have been much better.) But the worst was the disappointment my boyfriend had with the medium burger he ordered that was completely well done. And I could understand if it was busy, but it was very empty and to have the hot dogs and burger take about 20 minutes to come to our table seemed a bit long, but maybe made sense when the burger was well done :( A bit disappointed after a long wait to finally check out Galaxy Hut. So please take this as a review on the food, but from a beer selection, friendly/helfpul bartender they get a 4.
This is a small local beer bar. They rotate their beer selection, and often has some interesting choices. The door man is always friendly, and so are the bartenders/waiters. It can be hard to get a seat in here on the weekends, but week nights it's still a good hangout.I love the decor of the place, which is the reason for 3 stars instead of 2. They have cool artwork all around and the lighting is lovely.The tater tots here are amazing as a late night snack.
I didn't like the bartender the first time I visited this joint. He couldn't care less that we sat down at the bar and we left a few minutes later. That being said. The next time I was invited by an Arlington native a different bartender was attentive and friendly and that afforded me the chance to enjoy the chill atmosphere and great beer. No liquor at this joint. All the bartenders have to do is smile, pour and collect money. Is that too much to ask?
Pros: AMAZING beer selection, on tap and bottle, and good sizes to choose from! Great atmosphere. Great bar-food (I've had the hot dogs, tots, BLT and onion rings. All worth going back for again). Cons: Some snug seating: my husband and I got the pinball table, squeezed between the pacman and galactic something or other tables, which were occupied by an awkward couple we're guessing on a third date and another couple who probably just came from having casual relations and couldn't wait to go home to their respective houses. Also ordering food is somewhat awkward, but nothing to prevent me from going back again. verdict: please stay away so I can have this dive all for myself.
Yo, like, dude, which bierre are ya gonna get? Sure, this place has Family Guy style doodles on canvas on the walls (a thumbs up!); passable service where you ALWAYS have to order beers at the bar; food gets delivered to your table (whoa, like slow down with that concept!); and yes, they got vegan chili (thumbs up). It's crowded like "step on my toes and please spill some beer on my leg as well as you make your way through the line for the bar" -- yup, like, it's like that crowded.It's artsy fratboy central. Go if you like that kind of thing.
Con:People see me playing pacman with my girlfriend while drinking beer. It's so awesome I almost die every time.Pros: This place has awesome bar/pub food, a great beer selection, and a laid back atmosphere. If you hate the pretentious annoying Arlington crowd, and you know who I'm talking about...GO HERE.Wait, on second though, stay away. I want this place to remain as is, and odds are you're actually part of that crowd and hate yourself & your peers as much as the rest of us do.There's fun shit on the walls, and a few arcade machines used as tables. The patio has what appears to be the tip of a silo, cut open, with a table and round booth inserted inside. This is my favorite bar in Courthouse. FTW.Did I mention the beer selection?
Um...Yeah...I kinda love everything about this place. A LOT.The variety of beer (the pumpkin beer is de-LISH!), the art, the old school games (Pac Man, anyone?!), the sweet outdoor seating, and the location. PERFECT. They have this pretty sweet giant covered sitting area out back where you sit in what reminds me of an alien space ship created by a 5 year old. Just check it out - it's just a lamp and a table under this thing. They also have uncovered tables out back as well and they turn on the string lights which makes for a very pretty atmosphere in the evening. If you haven't been: Go! I thought Galaxy Hut was laid back and was a nice escape in the evening from every other place around it which was swarming with people. Can't wait to go back there to sit around with my pumpkin beer.
It's good that this place isn't located in the heart of Clarendon and other bars otherwise this will be the place to go for those nightcrawlers. The place is pretty small which is just how I like it. They have wonderful selection of beers but I think it's bit pricey - doesn't matter. I find myself keep coming here, order multiple beers, get drunk, and walk home. Thank god I live nearby from this place otherwise I'd be spending so much money on taxis. They do have happy hours but not the best deals in the neighborhood. It ain't matter, I'll still take $1 off my pint. Their foods are subpar. But seriously, does anybody really come here for foods?
I love this place. No, really, I LOVE this place. When I moved to NoVA from Maryland I wasn't sure where I was going to drink. Because let's face it Arlington, you're full of a lot of shitty frat bars. But then there was Dr. Dremos, Galaxy Hut, and Jay's. With the sad demise of Dremos a couple years ago, GHut (and Jay's to some extent) remains an awesome respite from the douchebag quotient in Clarendon. It only serves beer, good beer, beer I don't mind paying for. And the taps rotate to give you plenty of new tasty beer to try. PBR has a special place in my heart, but I come here for good craft beer that I like the taste of. The people that work here don't take themselves too seriously. Neither do the regulars. Its small, and with the smoking ban, there are alot of people who pack themselves in here that didn't used to step foot in the place. Still, if you can get a seat, its a great place to spend hours with your friends drinking top notch brews and downing bar (veg and omni) food. And lets not forget the tots. Tot love. And the micro bar outside. And the patio in general since it is now home of the old Dremos silo.
So i've been going to Galaxy hut on and off for 3 years. I've always liked this place, bring a lot of folks there after work and what not. Everyone loves the beer selection and atmosphere. Last night we went out for a birthday, nice sized group of 12 people, after being there for about 3 hours, and 10+ pitchers of their tasty beer, they tried to collect a $5 cover from our group, is it just me or is that a little silly? going after a cover charge retroactively? Poor business decision, Gal Hut, we finished up our night at Whitlows, the tip on the night alone would have covered the charge, not to mention the continued business that you may or may not get. Keep it classy Galaxy, you've earned my douche bag award for the day.
Galaxy Hut is my favorite bar in Clarendon. It's unpretentious, has an awesome beer selection, the music is always good, and you can play pinball. What's not to love?
My favorite bar in Arlington. They have a great beer selection, a patio to drink (and smoke) outside and AWESOME music (I think I heard all of Loveless and most of Daydream nation at the Hut once.) While I never had food here before, it was listed on the Washington Post Magazine as having one of the best hot dogs in the area.I love this place.
Fantastic beer selection :-)
Chili cheese tots. Consistently good beer on tap. Tiny patio. Tiny bathrooms. Tiny room. One of the best bars in the area. The fact that it has maintained its low key vibe as Whole Foods and modern-day Clarendon have metastasized around it makes it even more wonderful. Best feature--get in line under the sign to order your beer. Keeps everything running smoothly. Simple, genius.
great bar. i can't really say how it compares to other bars in the area, but it definitely compares favorably to bar in my home area. it had a good selection of beers, ranging in price from cheap bottles to $9 pints. it had a very relaxed vibe, and played very good music but was quiet enough to talk. i'd be a regular if i lived nearby.
I'm long overdue in writing a review of this place. It is, simply, the best bar in North Arlington. SInce Dr. Dremo's closed (and even when it existed, I'd argue), G-Hut has been by far the best place to go to escape the overgrown fratboy/sorrority girl meat market in Clarendon. While often super crowded, the vibe in here is eclectic and unique to the core. Just being there, checking out the quirky paintings and the table top video games, makes you feel good.As for the beer? Amazing selection. Always 20+ selections on tap, frequently rotated while keeping some favorites. Then, there's another 30 or so bottled beers, all at reasonable prices for the are. While they do serve the hipster stand-by PBR, it seems like most of the folks that visit tend to have better taste in beer and celebrate Galaxy Hut for their selection.The food, while certainly nothing to write home about, is better than your average bar food. The "chicken tenders" are basically whole chicken breasts... pretty absurd. They also frequently cram bands into their small space and, though I've never been there for the live music, it seems to be pretty popular and keeps the place busy even on Mondays.Bottom line, though, is that there's no better place to be in North Arlington to relax, unwind and avoid the ridiculous of the rest of the area. It's an institution, a must-try. Go there. Do it. Now.
I love coming to Galaxy Hut for a drink or two and to relax. The bar is small, but I like compactness of it. If you do want some air, there's a side door that leads to a tiny back patio. Eclectic art hangs on the wall and some of the tables are old arcade games. If the arcade games don't bring back some nostalgia, then the tater tots offered on the bar menu will.
Best bar in Arlington.(RIP Dremo's)
For this NY transplant, Galaxy Hut helps ease my missing of Brooklyn-esque bars. Really cool place with incredible beer selection and fun outdoor space if you can snag a seat!
Believe the hype!There is something about this place. You can't quite put your finger on it. They are committed to a nice atmosphere, precise service and an amazing selection of beers. Pros: The decor is really hip and you don't want to forget about the fun patio area. I've never had a bad beer here. The food is quality for what it is. No confusion about ordering and bills - it's all labeled and simplified. Vegetarian options, if you care (I don't).Cons: Sometimes crowded. No full bar - beer, wine and cider only.
By far my favorite bar in Arlington and perhaps in the whole DC metro area. The tap selection is always rotating with out-of-this-world, hard-find-anywhere-else beers and the bottle selections is outstanding. The ambiance reminds me of a carnival fun-house gone terribly wrong. Several tables are plexiglass over functioning Pac Man machines, awesome. The food is pretty normal bar fare, but it's satisfying. This is strictly a beer bar, no liquor. They have music several nights a week, you'd have to check the schedule for specifics. Sometimes there's a cover, which is lame, but I think it goes to help out the musicians. The Hut gets really crowded on the weekends and some week nights. They have a unique line system (you queue up) for ordering which takes some getting used to but ultimately it's more fair than the typical free-for-all at most bars. It feels a little hipster at times but the staff is really friendly, no pretentious or elitist behavior.  If you're in the mood for some great beer, a great atmopshere try it out. The Galaxy Hut is a welcome departure from the dime-a-dozen "Irish" bars and other meat markets taking up space along Clarendon and Wilson Boulevards.
Amazing beer list and great food considering it's a bar. It can get crazy crowded so go early. Prices are a little high but not unreasonable for high end microbrews. A fun crowd without all the drunk college kids you get in Georgetown.
Getting better with age? Smoke free, great service and tasty brews. We hit Screwtop and then grabbed an easy metered (free Saturday) space for a brew at the Hut. It's nice to hit the peripheral Clarendon spots and skip the me-too mob in the center. The Tuppers Keller Pils was quite tasty. Has it really been twenty years since this place opened? Saturday night used to mean a Vietnamese restaurant and this place was open. Since then, my new baby has graduated from high school. Good to have a haven, great to have beers and tots. Cheers!
umm what can I say? this is it. Beers cold, and selection is good. But it is kinda well different. Why da think they call it the Galaxy Hut? Aint me....
Galaxy Hut is an oasis within the packed blocks of Clarendon and it's often fratty bars.They have an excellent beer selection. If you're a beer fanatic and crave beer on most occasions, this bar is a can't miss. Their draft selection tends to change, and they have a variety of craft and imported beers.The bartenders are friendly, and the atmosphere laid-back. If you're looking for a chi-chi scene, or want to pay $8 for a very small glass of imported beer a la Brasserie Beck, this isn't the place for you.  This bar is a "dive" bar in the sense that it's not much to look at, but they certainly offer more then Miller and Bud.I went for happy hour a couple weeks ago, and met two friends. They have a good happy hour deal- $3 off draft pitchers. All in all, this is an affordable Arlington bar.GH definitely tends to fill up fast. They also have an outdoor patio area, so check that out if inside is packed.
Galaxy Hut is pretty much unlike any other bar in Arlington, and that's a good thing.Every time I've been here the bar has been busy without being packed. The selection of microbrews is top-notch. The atmosphere is cozy, even if the artwork on the walls is slightly disturbing. The prices... they're a tad on the high side, but I've come to accept that this is OK. In fact, it may even be a good thing. Arlington needs more places like this; but as long as it keeps adding new places "to be seen", Galaxy Hut will stand out among the rest.First of all, this is a bar where you can come frequently and drink beers from around the world that you've never tasted before. Second of all, this isn't a bar where you come to get trashed. If you have any appreciation for the beers, you'll pace yourself accordingly while here. The set-up is such that you can only order from a single spot at the bar. This occasionally leads to seemingly long lines, but believe me, it's infinitely better than having a bunch of aggressive drunks going belly up to the bar and waving around 20-dollar bills. This is one of the few bars where you pay a lot, but you truly get what you pay for.
My kind of pub...seriously...Been so wanting to go to Galaxy Hut for what seems like ages. Last night I managed to visit the Hut after polishing a giant Hunan One beer. I was hanging out with my 'lil brother Oscar and it was a night for us brothers to bond over conversations about sports, women, the future and life. Okay, well maybe not all our time was spent talking about sports but definitely the last three topics made up the basis of most of our chatter. :-)After the brother's quick pit stop at Cheesecake Factory, we walked down the street towards Galaxy Hut. Entering the Hut, we were carded (an honor for an old dog like me) and I noticed that the place was dark and had the cool chill bar setting that I used to frequent pre-kids and pre-wife. I knew that although the wife probably would not enjoy just such a setting, it really spoke to me. Two table video games were off to the side and a big cardboard arrow pointing to the register hung above the bar. On one of the side walls a sign read, "Order at the Arrow (unless sitting at the bar)".Easy enough...I could do that...Because the Hut is so small, Oscar quickly found his friend and we all said our hellos and stood next to the bar. While Oscar and his buddy caught up, I scoped out the various brews available on draft and settled on a pint of the Bell's Oberon Wheat Ale. The 'lil brother was kind enough to buy the first round and after grabbing a table, we settled into our brews and began to chat. The Hut was full of people and there seemed to be a steady stream of bodies entering the small bar and standing in line for some brews. As we all sat talking at the table, I saw the waitress bring out a plate with two hot dogs and a generous helping of tater tots to a couple sitting at the Galaga video game table. Before I could catch myself I muttered loudly, "Umm...tater tots!""Yeah, they have tater tots here" replied one of Oscar's buddies (our table had now grown from three to five. I was reminded how hungry I was and scanned our table for a menu. None around....We kept chatting about life, work and women and soon saw the bottom of our beer glasses. With the last drop of beer gone, we soon wrapped up our conversation and decided to head down the street to grab a bite to eat. By this time the place was quite full and people were happy to see us leave in order to pounce on our now empty table. I really enjoyed my visit to the Galaxy Hut and wondered how soon I could return or how I could trick the wife into joining me here for at least one pint. Very cool place and it's a refreshing change from all the other rowdy frat boy bars around the Clarendon / Courthouse area. The Hut is the kind of pub that someone like me would enjoy visiting after a long busy week, where I could enjoy some tasty brews.I'll be baaaaaaaaack! And that's a promise! Maybe on my next visit I'll be able to enjoy some of those tater tots that made my stomach grumble and my mouth water. :-)
I pretty much love Galaxy Hut. It's a little off the beaten path and doesn't have the same college-aged clientele as many of the other bars in Clarendon, but if you love a good dive bar, this one's for you! They have 20 craft and imported beers on tap--most of which you won't see anywhere else--and around 30 bottled beers. They don't serve liquor, but who cares? As far as entertainment goes, they have pinball, Ms. Pac Man, and galaga/space invaders cocktail arcade tables, a megatouch machine, and a jukebox. The food is pretty good, vegetarian friendly (if that's your thing) food menu is very tasty, and available 7 days a week until 11 pm. There is live music every Sunday and Monday night.If you're a Galaxy Hut regular, you'll probably see me in the "hut" on the back patio. It's awesome.
Simply put, this is the best bar in the universe. Rotating microbrews, vegan bar food, small and cozy, and even though it gets so loud, it's hard to actually hear the shitty, yuppie douche bags that have over run Arlington. In all the years it's stood it's ground and kept it's identity. Larry has really kept the essence of the place, but tweaked everything just enough to make it an outstanding place to meet friends, catch a few brews and munch some awesome grub.
Eh, I don't know about this place. Good beer selection, yes. Ambiance, no. If you like dive bars with eclectic clientele then this is your place. If you like a scene like Liberty Tavern, this is not your place.
Great happy hour, over priced shuffle board
There are so few bars in the D.C. area that I really love...this is one of them. It's just a cool place...so cool that I feel like I'm not helping their cause when I go there straight from work. I feel like I should get some tatoos, change into a T-shirt from an obscure band that no one has heard of and put my earrings in which I haven't worn in 10 years. Don't get me wrong, the workers are always very nice and don't make me feel out of place, but I know that I don't fit in with much of the clientele, but honestly I don't care here...I like it.The beer list is great and the bar food is just right. I always go with some form of hotdog and I'm never disappointed. The beer prices are a little high in my opinion, but I'm happy to pay it.This place used to be very smokey...in fact I think it was as much a smokers bar as it was a beer bar. The bar tenders would smoke as they poured you your beers. The smoking ban has definitely changed that pushing the smokers out onto their patio. I'm glad for the clean air inside, but I hope it doesn't hurt their business too much...I don't want this place going under.I find it hard to write reviews of my favorite bars (see Blind Tiger in NYC) because I don't know why I like them...they're just cool. It's one of those things that I feel like saying..."just trust me". This place is cool.
performing arts? what? really liked the atmosphere, small place, had a party of 5 which grew to 7 and they didn't rush us at all. really attentive. as sherry w. said, great tater tots! really crispy and also great grilled cheese sandwiches. lots of beer selections and really interesting paintings/drawings on the walls
Arlington needs more places like Galaxy Hut. This place is worth checking out just for their amazing beer selection, which changes all the time. You would have a real hard time trying to find some of the beer they serve elsewhere in the DC area. It's not a particularly big place. I went there on a Sunday night to see a friend perform and the place was practically full. It has a hipster vibe to it, but still has the appeal of a neighborhood bar.
Great beer selection! There's interesting art on the walls and live music every Sunday/Monday? (get there early for a seat, place fills up quick)In addition, they have old school video games! The ones where the screen is your table top! Gotta love it...I haven't had the food, but I really liked my first excursion there and will be back soon....
I "heart" the Hut!There is something cozy about the hut that always brings me back...maybe it is the wall of fabulous beers on tap, maybe the line of amiable lushes to talk to while waiting for a beer, maybe the tater tots and corn dogs....regardless it feels like home and I love it.
As said before, cool laid back place to grab a good beer and chat. you have to order from the bar and its usually pretty damn crowded so it might be nice to have a backup bar in mind if you swing through with a crowd.
Cool laid back joint...love the space and size of the venue. Great to watch bands. When we were there we saw a great Canadian band called Vicious Guns playing. The first singer was really good too...the third awwww-ight. Didn't stay too long after they started playing.They have a great beer menu (sorry cocktail drinkers you got to diversify). The bartender was AWESOME she tended bar and did the sound system . Very chill spot. I appreciated the old skool video arcade tables.
Quickly turning into my favorite local haunt. Be prepared to meet some really cool people.And yes, next to the incredible selection of beers, the tator tots are amazing!
Hands down my favorite bar in Virgina, and possibly the DC Metro. The grilled cheese is amazing (get it with tomato), and their tater tots have to be the best tots I have ever had. You wouldn't think that tots could be made better or worse, but trust me, they are the best you have ever had.Their beer selection is always excellent. My first time coming to Galaxy Hut, I got myself a delicious Unibroue Tres Pistoles, which just so happens to be me favorite beer that I can never find on tap, but they had it.Also, they have an old corn silo sitting outside that they converted into a circular lounge. Sweeet.
There's trying hard to be cool, and then there's trying waaaaaaaaaaaay to hard to be indie - but it works here. From the artwork to the painted ceiling tiles to the pinball and pacman tables, this place is very anti, and it's proud of it. The beer selection is epic, for a bar its size I must give it major props, damn impressive Belgians. Good music - walked in to Master of Puppets, then went to Frightened Rabbit. Only issue is that you need to come with a crew and get a table, as there are limited places for a solo artist to work or exist - standing alone feels VERY alone there I must say.But if you like good Belgian beers, good music, chill venue, and very indie style - then this is the spot for you.
Dont go to Galaxy Hut if you want to be seen...Dont go to Galaxy Hut if you want to celebrate at a chic place...Dont go to Galaxy Hut if you want to impress a date...Do go to Galaxy Hut if you want to chill - sometimes very close to the next group!Do go to Galaxy Hut if you like local dive bars!Do go to Galaxy Hut if you just plain want to have a good time being just you!This is the local dive bar that the locals enjoy! Though that is changing fast....I have been a fan of this place for many years now - even before the Liberty Taverns, Harry's Tap Room, etc. even dreamed of coming to Clarendon!Its a small little place tucked away in the slowly but disappearing "mom and pop" landscape of Clarendon!Make sure you get your ID with you coz you need that to get even get an empty glass - no exceptions! :)One of my favorite beers here? Its BBC Jefferson's Reserve Bourbon Stout!Go check it you...
Let me start off by saying that GHut is my friends' favorite bar in Arlington, by far. The beer selection is amazing. We all have different tastes in beer, but there's plenty for all of us, and there's always something on tap that we can all agree on. The food is pretty much typical bar eats, but the chicken fingers with teriyaki sauce is a must-have every time we go. Seriously, try it at least once. The only reason this place lost a star is because of it's size. On weekend nights it is always packed, with the line for the bar often reaching the front door. As much as I love this place, the crowd is often enough for me to want to go someplace else. I've been a few times right at 5 though, and it makes for a great after-work drink spot.
The Galaxy Hut is easily my favorite bar in the world. The only bad thing about it is that I wish there was something like it in every neighborhood anywhere.Fantastic beer selection, surprisingly good bar food, a small outdoor area that's perfect in the summertime, always excellent music over the speakers and a fantastic local feel make this place perfect. I haven't been to many shows there in a while, and I actually prefer to go on Friday nights when it feels more like a local spot than a show spot, but I do love that it's a small place where new bands can get a show.
I used to know one of the transplanted bar tenders that used to work at Portners in Old Town. Not a bad place to grab a drink or listen to live music if you can stomach the "hipster" crowd.
Galaxy Hut is the perfect place for people who can have good conversations. If you are with a group of people you don't particularly like but just happen to be going out with, or if you are looking to get wasted and hook up or something, don't go here. If instead you want to go somewhere you can actually have a conversation and enjoy your companions, Galaxy Hut is the place. It's very small; intimate by necessity. The music will always be understated and just loud enough. You can expect to hear radiohead and indie music every time. They only serve beer and house wine, and you can only order at the bar. The beer selection is second to none. The food is perfectly good pub grub. You can count on it to be well prepared and flavorful, although it won't be more complicated than hot dogs or chili.
I'll admit, I kind of have a soft spot for the Galaxy Hut. How can you NOT like a bar where most of the tables are interactive? Combine great beer, decent food, fine music, and classic arcade games tableside (literally, IN the table) and you have a clear winner. I've never been on a live music night- usually Sundays and Mondays, 9pm, $5 cover- but I can imagine it would be quite the intimate experience. This place seems cozy even without a band playing!I've only ever been on quieter mid-week nights, but the bartender is always chill and we've never had trouble getting a table and prompt food service. This was also one of the first bars I discovered when I moved to DC, so it holds an honorary place at the top of my list.
Once part of the "Big 2" of Wilson Blvd. bars (along with the sadly departed Dr. Dremo's), Galaxy Hut now stands in a class of its own. Good beer is always on the menu, although they seem to have a lot of bad selections as well. I often find good Rogue selections there and, much to my delight, I recently found Bell's Hopslam on the menu (and managed to get obliterated by the 10\% abv beer without even trying).The food is okay, about what you would expect from the hipster dive bar that it is. There are tons of good vegetarian options, which is a rarity in DC. Basically, I wouldn't recommend a meal there, but the food is perfect to accompany your beer.Finally, the ambiance is ideal. Nothing fancy, unless you manage to sit at one of the tables with 1980s video games. Just a solid place to enjoy some good brews and good conversation. What more can you ask?
I was lucky enough to stumble across this place with my good friend and his brother a year ago. A small, quirky slice of paradise with old video games for tables, random artwork (which I couldn't resist making the background on my cell phone), and a phenomenal yet affordable beer selection. Everyone in northern Virginia should consider themselves extremely lucky to have access to Troeg's on tap!What Galaxy Hut doesn't have is of equal importance. Pretentious people, terrible music, expensive drink prices, and anything even approaching generic cannot be found in the friendly confines of the Galaxy Hut. One visit and I'm sold!
I like having "go-to's" in DC's different neighborhoods. Give me Bar Pilar on U Street, Hank's in Dupont, the Pug on H Street, any day of the week and I'll be happier than a pig in...you get the picture. The Galaxy Hut makes my go-to list for Clarendon. I mean, they have Kasteel Rouge on tap. For me, that's as much of a recommendation as you can have. It's small and cozy, chances are you can catch a slightly bizarre band playing guitar much too close to your head, or as I encountered the other night, a drinking and drawing club set-up and sketching away. It's eclectic and un-pretentious at the same time and as the cherry on top they serve some mighty good tater tots. What more could you ask for?
Ghut is like your buddy's basement, but converted into the best hangout spot ever. Many, many moons ago I heard about the ghut - an artsy, non sports bar in clarendon? Well, that sounded all kinds of awesome but I held off since I knew it was beer and wine only...and I don't drink beer, and have been burned too many times by vinegary, warm bar wine. shiver....I should have gone sooner! They have yummy cider and raspberry framboise, for the non beer drinkers - and, as many reviews point out, a rather epic beer selection to keep everyone happy! I may even have to try a couple out! Mmmm. Christmas lights and video games supply most of the lighting, and awesome local art adorns the walls. Everything feels so cozy. Oh yes! Bonus points for doing things in a way that makes sense! If you get some food (the chicken sandwich was pretty dern tasty) sans side you save $1.50! awesome! All places should deduct money if you order things without a side. Right? Love it. Thanks, Galaxy Hut - you give me a warm fuzzy feeling. And I think it was more than just the cider
It's a good thing for me I don't live in Clarendon, because I would be at Galaxy Hut at least twice a week. This is a fantastic spot, and I have to thank Venu for picking it as the spot to host this years Bell's HopSlam release, and Justin S, Keri M, Ben M, Tony P, and Hyunoo P for showing up and making it more fun. A decent sized group of us showed up to enjoy it on draft here, a rarity for this awesome seasonal beer, and the staff tried to help us accommodate as many people as possible as they all showed up throughout the night.I really loved the atmosphere at Galaxy Hut. It's pretty small, but it never felt cramped on a Saturday night. The art on the walls is really cool too, very quirky with a funny edge (especially liked the guy on the wall by the bar who was literally "pushing up daisies"). The bar seems sort of like an almost hipster place, but too cool for them to actually go to. There's even a giant arrow sign above the bar/register showing everyone where to place their orders. There are no "waiters" in the traditional sense, everything is ordered from the bar and then brought over to your table, with the exception of the beers which are picked up right there.As for the beers, that's easily the best reason to come here, and if you're a fan of craft beers / microbrews and just all around damn good beer, you've gotta get over here and sample some of their selections. Not only is there a really large and diverse selection of high quality beers, but they're also extremely cheap, especially compared to prices elsewhere in DC and the Arlington area. Pints range anywhere from $6-8, for beers that are usually close to the 10\% alcohol range, very rare in DC.Another nice bonus here was the food was actually pretty decent, considering it is at heart a bar. I wouldn't come here with the intention of just dining, but it's nice to have good food available when you're already drinking. We started out with an order of the nachos, with chili and sour cream. It was kind of weird how they put the salsa and sour cream on the side instead of actually over the chips like the chili, but I guess it's all the same in the end, although I wish there was a bit more available to add to them. I decided to get a couple of the bacon cheddar hot dogs as well, with jalapenos added. I really loved the abundance of peppers they put on, and the pieces of bacon were really generous too, I just wish they had used slightly better cheese and more of it. The fries on the side were a bit mediocre, but they were just extra anyway. Nicole got the Chic-n-chips, which also came with the fries, but the real star was the huge breasts of chicken. It was a really nice spin on the traditional chicken tenders most places have, and I liked the flavor of the breading. Tony ordered a boat of tater tots at the end of the night that everyone snacked on, and I actually liked them significantly more than the fries, so when you get the choice definitely pick them instead. Another point which didn't really matter to me, but should be nice for some of you out there, is that basically every menu item has a vegetarian or vegan option, kind of rare for a bar, but not as surprising when you get here and take in the whole aura of the place.
4.5 stars for not being Brickskeller or Pizzeria Paradiso, but for being the best beer selection in VA.It's all about the beer - everything else is secondary. The selection is amazing - maybe 15 on tap, another 15-20 in bottles of tastefully selected craft brews. Start light and work up to the darks, and definitely ask the bartenders for recommendations. Tell them what you like and ask about which ones you absolutely need to try before it gets rotated out.The atmosphere is artsy-indie, but not in a bad way. The music is always great and the jukebox carries some fantastic selections. Sitting at the bar just by yourself you will meet some very friendly people. Bring some friends and it's a party. It will seem like everyone in the place is in a band, and that's not necessarily a bad thing either.I thought this place was going to die after the smoking ban - it clearly does not have the room to install proper ventilation, and its customers were 90-100\% smokers on any given night. Smoking during winter now involves huddling around the heat fan right next to the outside patio door. But ironically, apparently it's doing really well ever since the smoking ban. I just feel bad for the bartender who used to chainsmoke his way through his shifts.
My all time favorite bar! I used to go here all the time, and now only occasionally - but it is still my #1. Now that VA bars are no longer so smokey, I think I'll be visiting Galaxy Hut more often! This place has undergone some changes over the years, but things are just getting better and better. The ambiance is still artsy and cool, the beers are ALWAYS good, and the food is tastier (heeellooo tater tots!). The bar seems to get more crowded much earlier these days than it used to, so you may need to get there early if you want to nab a table/seat. There's also an outdoor alley that has been nicely refurbished with tables and chairs (and that old silo-bench-thing from Dr. Dremo's!) - but I like to sit inside where I can hear the music. I love you Galaxy Hut!
Must stand under the gigantic arrow to order beer, food, water, anything. Unless you are seated at the bar. Smoking is outside on the patio, which hurts those sitting inside when the door swings open and the cold comes in. I would recommend some blanket type barrier I've seen at other places during the winter. The food is vegetarian friendly, which is so nice. I don't eat meat, but that doesn't mean a chili dog with onions, tots and a quality beer aren't my ideal of a favorite meal. They are, and can be found here. I would also say the beer is a bit expensive, at $5-9 a pint. However, the selection is silly considering the small size of the place.
I like this place, even if it is in Clarendon/Rosslyn. Good beers on tap, and pitchers. When I used to come out here to the Whole Foods I always stopped here coming or going, depending if anything in the bag was going to melt on me. Good place to meet friends and just hangout at a table draining pitchers. I can't really call it a dive bar, not that that is a bad thing, it just isn't as shiny as some places and that's just fine. This place without smoking just doesn't seem to make any sense to me.
Guys, I've made it. Not only to my 100th review, but more importantly, to the point in my Yelp career where I can say, "man, I need a beer!". Of course, for my 100th review, I had to choose a place to rave about that's second to none and is just totally bitchin', all around. No better place to review than a little place called Galaxy Hut. I've been a long time patron of this holy grail of a bar for awhile now, for a number of reasons. Main reason is that it's a kitschy, little bar (maximum capacity: 48-ish) that's unique to this neighborhood (if you live in Arlington, you know what I'm talking about). You can avoid the Clarendon Grill/ Clarendon Ballroom crowds and get a tall frosty glass of craft suds at a decent price. 2) This place ONLY serves beer. No frou frou drinks served here! Quite frankly-- if a bar focuses on only having beer, you can really delve into trying new beers that you can't find on tap (or in bottle) anywhere else in the area. 3) The regulars. Everyone right down to the bartenders (hi Bill!) to your fellow alcoholics... I mean... beer enthusiasts can recommend a good brew and engage in some good old fashioned bar banter. 4) THE BEER LINE! You WILL get called out if you try and cut! While the beer line can get a bit hairy sometimes, it almost guarantees that no d-bags will cut in front of you-- first come, first serve. Honorable mentions: karaoke night/ iPod dj nights, pinball machines and can't forget the tater tots!All that, coupled with awesome artwork (Ben Claassen, is that you?), a sweet patio (my favorite stakeout during the months of April-October) and a digital jukebox, there really isn't a better place to be. That being said, I say we go hop in the beer line and grab a round of tough guy sodas at Galaxy Hut-- whaddya say?
Been going here for upwards of a dozen years now. This place is the real deal - an independent microbrew bar that has managed to maintain its personality in the face of all the changes Clarendon has seen in the past decade. The owner is serious about rotating his tap offerings, and the staff is knowledgeable about them. There is usually a good selection of dark beers, which is more than can be said about other "beer bars" that concentrate mostly on medium- to light-bodied ales.The atmosphere, with the humorous artwork, vintage video games, and great indie music, is a trip.Yes, the place is small, especially if a band is playing. Yes, it can take a while to get a beer at prime time. No, you can't get a mixed drink. But for anyone who's into beer, a visit here is a no-brainer.
Thank God for Yelp... because if it weren't for Yelp, I would not have never met tina r. and would have never ventured to Galaxy Hut to meet her. So there, Yelp HQ. tina r. is GREAT FOR YELP! In yo' face! Speaking honestly, this place rocks. GH offers cheap beer and quick service. There's absolutely no way someone can sneak in at the bar and "cut you" for a giant arrow points you to where you need to order. This place only sells beer and wine but like I said - cold and cheap. What more do you need? Also, they have a small selection of really good nonalcoholic beers. Yeah, I quit drinking... or at least for the month of December. The bar itself is pretty small but the layout is efficient. Outside you'll find covered areas either for drinking your pints or smoking your cigarettes. They are indeed smoker friendly. Also, I recommend trying their food. Jason G. talked me into getting the grilled chicken sandwich and FOR ONCE IN MY LIFE - the chicken in said chicken sandwich was not dry! YAAAAAAY! In my opinion, Galaxy Hut is the best bar in Clarendon. Hands down. The end.
This is a pretty cool bar, but would be much better if it had more space! There is a great beer selection and low-key dive bar atmosphere. Small outdoor section exists which helps to expand the place, but not by much. This is not the place to go if you are looking for a crazy night with dancing and loud music, but it can be nice to meet and catch up with friends. (unless its karaoke night and your eardrums are blasted with bad singing)
This place is pretty cool even if its not really my kind of place. It has lots of different beers and a cool unpretentious atmosphere. When I went there it was somewhat smokey (although not too much), but now that there is a smoking ban I think i'd be happier in there.They seemed to have a wide beer selection and I was convinced by a friend to try some cider they had (alcoholic cider). It was pretty neat and I thought it was really cool that a place had that. If you like dives you'll love this place, if you're slightly preppy/like dressing up this is not your place.
3 Blocks walk? CheckGreat beers on tap? CheckDivey/artsy atmosphere? CheckNow smoke free in Virginia? Check check.Love that I now live where I can have a neighborhood bar, and this is the one of my choosing.
I have so many good memories involving Galaxy Hut.- Ace Pear Cider- My friends DJ'ing on occasion- The quirky tables with bits and pieces lacquered underneath- Sentai shows back in the day......and so on. A crock of memories for such a small place but wholly worthy of my adoration. GALAXYHUT
You know, if Galaxy Hut wasn't in Arlington, I would be there every. Single. Night. Not that I dislike Arlington, it's just antithetical to where I live and where I work, so I rarely find myself there. However, Galaxy Hut has wonderful...everything, frankly. Wonderful atmosphere, wonderful beer, wonderful food. It's quirky and fun and casual. I just wish it were downtown.
It was a time for celebration, it was a time for commiseration, it was a time for folly, it was a time for sagacity, it was the end of an era, it was the birth of uncertainty, it was a time to spent in mourning, it was a time to be spent in revelry, in short - it was a time to say goodbye to the archangel of merry mischief. I had never been to this little hole-in-the-wall bar in the land of brown flip-flops, and all I could see as I stepped through the door was smokey blackness, and the tiny blips and glows of vintage video games. I managed to find the bar and ran into a fellow yelper that I was meeting that night, the archangel herself - the world famous, Tina R. She told me that a couple of other yelpers had a table outside and to meet up after I got my beer. The beers were plentiful and varied. Tucked down an alley like patio, was a shanty silo that sheltered fellow yelpers Ben, Talia, Vasily, Hanna/Empress and Jimena. We all sat together under the guise of yelp, rap video brainstorming session, but what we what was really happening - was a buzzy therapy session. So we drank and talked and lamented and laughed, as fellow yelpers Brian/Yella, Tracey, S B, the other Ben, Michelle, Farzan, Lydia, and some other guy I can't remember, all trickled in and joined the fray. Some yelpers ordered tater tots and they were good tater tots. I would say, perhaps, the best tater tots I have ever had eaten. Even our soon-to-be CM, the lovely, young Tara meet up with us pig yelpers. It was a yelp night. The beers and memories and silliness flowed like a river of honey. Alas, all good things in life, this night had to come to an end. I finished my beer and said good night to Tina R. Although, she was still a fellow yelper - she was no longer the archangel, her tongue having been cut out by vindictive flaggerots. Those tater tots tasted so sweet. Bittersweet.
Really cool ambience and ecclectic decor. You can smoke in there (and boy people sure do). Decided to eat here after walking by it 100 times. I had one beer (draft) and it was NOT cold which made it very hard to choke down. We ordered food but it seemed to take forever to come out (and there was not a lot of food coming out of the kitchen - so they weren't backed up). The macaroni and cheese was pretty good, but nothing to rush back for. The chicken strips were like an overgrown McNugget, the tater tots were overcooked, my girlfriend's hummich (hummus sandwich) was kind of cruddy too. The frequent patrons of the bar seemed to have a good time. The bartender left a lot to be desired and wasn't very friendly - actually almost rude.
I like Galaxy Hut.Now, Galaxy Hut has nothing to do with anarchy in general. It's just a beautiful, wonderful, funny, witty, loving, sexy, tough-as-nails, little weird bar, and I absolutely adore it.I like Galaxy Hut a lot.
awesome atmosphere. great beer selection,tots, and hot onion rings what else do you need! again fantastic clientele and jukebox. retro video games...if you get the chance
Galaxy hut....where have you been all this time? Finally popped in here with a couple of some college friends who now work in the area. Great interior that was pleasantly absent douches trying to pick up on the people I was with and collared shirts. Great beer selection. Truly great. And they serve it up in glass pitchers. I didn't know glass pitchers even existed anymore. The prices were pretty decent as well. The one thing that could prolly make this is a better place would be a micros system for electronically tracking bar tabs or just making it cash only. And standing in line to order you beer kinda sucks but I understand that they have limited space to work with.
Ok several "best bar" wins have created an influx of douchbaggery into my favorite bar, but thats ok, they deserve their money. Great staff, great food, inexpensive by arlington standards. Did I mention they have an amazing beer selection. One of the best low key bars ever. I used to go regularly, but not as much anymore, but that hasnt deminished my love for the place. My only negative I would say is the recent elimination of the brownie sunday. HOW DARE YOU LARRY!!!!
A marvelous place to get a beer (or cider, my preference) and some decent bar food (maybe the most decentest bar food I have ever had). Expect to want to become a regular.
True story: I took a friend to Galaxy Hut for her birthday a couple years ago. She was instantly turned off by the interior. We ordered some beers and snacks. She went up to the bar and asked if the staff could sing her "happy birthday" when they brought out the food. The girl behind the counter sneered under her breath and I heard something that sounded a lot like "this isn't a goddamn Applebee's". Yes. Beautiful. My kind of place. It feels so out of place in Clarendon, and I love it. p.s. I later made it up to my friend by taking her to Chili's, and all was right with the world.
After coming back here a few more times, I must say that the ordering system that they have is really starting to tick me off. You have to wait in line in one line at the bar in order to get beer, which would be fine, except for the fact that their tabs are not computerized. The guy has to flip through the entire book of tickets to find your tab, and it takes a while when they're busy (which is almost always). They still get major kudos for the beer selection and the atmosphere, but I've been avoiding it more and more just because I don't like having to stand there for 20 minutes every time I want a beer.
Fantastic little bitty bar. Fantastic beer selection (last time I was there, the Bell's Oktoberfest... on tap... was perfect). They also carry Kasteel Rouge, which is my favorite girly drink beer ever.I haven't been to GHut that often, but every occasion was memorable. That night I hung out with this dude... which turned into a date... who I'm now marrying. There was that time. Or the time I came for a work happy hour, with the young kids from my office who are actual hipsters (unlike me). I am in love with the onion rings. And their black bean burger.
I lived in NoVA for 2 years, and rarely found a reason to go out anywhere else besides the Hut. It's just one of those unique places that makes you feel like you are welcome and belong no matter who you are - in the number of times I was patronizing the place I saw hipsters, townies, groups of business people, bro dudes, and plain old normal people sitting in close proximity to one another and enjoying themselves. My fiancee and I seemed to quickly gain regular status, and would be greeted warmly by the bartenders that we saw frequently. The draft selection was spectacular and rotated frequently. There were some standards that seemed to always be there but sometimes you'd go in and get a rare steal on, say, a pitcher of Dogfish Head Palo Santo (who serves this stuff in a pitcher?!) and get everybody drunk for $25. There were a solid contingent of bottles and cans that fleshed out the selection, so PBR-swigging cheapskates could drink happily alongside Belgian-sipping beer geeks.While good service and quality beer are good starts, it was probably the food that kept us coming back. The sentence I used most frequently when describing the Hut was "they really know how to work a freakin' deep fryer," and I truly meant it. But alongside fries, onion rings, corn dogs, and tater tots, the rest of the menu never disappointed. Veggie chili dogs and seitan cheesesteaks can be found right alongside carnivore fare like pulled BBQ and burgers - and don't get me started on their nachos, which destroyed nearly every other nacho plate I've ever been served.So you've got good bartenders, good beer, good food - what about the place? It's probably fair to call it something of a hipster dive, but with a lot of heart. Funny illustrative paintings and comics from a local artist lined the walls, including the well-loved "bear and bunny talking at table with interchangeable word boards". There is a tiny, muted TV over the bar that either plays a local sports event or Turner Movie Classics. It's dim, fairly smoky at times, and kinda small - so you can find yourself without a table when it's busy. I always liked going a bit earlier than true "bar time", which made it much easier to grab a table with friends and eat some dinner. The outside seating is in a narrow alley between two buildings, but the back of the alley features the awesome metal hut with padded seating that can easily fit a group of 6 or so - good luck snagging it! So yeah, I love the Hut. I miss the Hut. I will go back to the Hut immediately the next time I go back to Arlington, most likely BEFORE I even arrive at my intended destination (note: I have done this in the past). If you live in NoVA and need a place to be a regular at, I can't think of a better place to choose.
I like this place alot, but it could do with being a bit bigger. Standing room is not really an option in this place. The outdoor setting is good, but not for groups.
Loved it!It could have been the awesome group of yelpers, FINALLY meeting Tina, the celebration of Tina's bday, the handful of tiny penises everywhere, the best chicken fingers I have had outside of my own making or the loving memory of tater tots when I was a little Tali come rushing back to me as we scarfed down 5 baskets of them.It could be one, it could be them all but I loved Galaxy Hut. Although they stopped serving my Founders, I did really enjoy the Terrapin Coffee Stout. Yum, Yum.
I hauled my ass from Germantown to Clarendon to celebrate Miss Tina's birthday. During the hour long ride I realized that I must really like this chick and the other fabulous Yelpers that I've recently met.Galaxy Hut makes me feel like I'm in a bar with friends who've just finished their shift at at a Lower East Side bar, only I didn't have to travel 4 hours on a Chinatown bus to get there. I'm loving the fun cartoonish artwork on the walls, the low lighting, and the vibe of the mellow crowd. Cider fans, they not only have it in a bottle but on tap as well. They also carry framboise and delicious Kasteel Rouge. These choices and a cute bartender means that I can forgive the lack of hard liquor and if you like a place with a large variety of beers you'll feel the same way. We were seated outdoors in "The Silo", a cool area on the patio that looks like a refurbished silo. It is the perfect setting for a group of loud and rowdy people to answer Inside the Actors' Studio questions. Next time I want to get a turn on Miss Pac Man. I can only imagine how much better I'd be at it with a couple of drinks in me.
How is it possible that I haven't written a review of the Hut yet? My fiance and I just moved away from DC, and the Galaxy Hut is probably the place we miss the most.Things I miss about the Hut, just off the top of my head:- the fryer and anything they put in it, specifically the onion rings, though they changed the batter at some point in the last year. It's still fantastic, but not AS fantastic as before.- bartender Bill, rarely seen without a cigarette hanging out of his mouth, though I suppose that'll change when the smoking ban goes into effect- the cute bartender who had a hipster mullet but saw the error of his ways- the veggie cheesesteak, the definitely not veggie corn dog, and the chili dogs (veggie or not) - see previous note about fried things- the jukebox!- Brother Thelonius on draft, in addition to many, many other solid beers- Wednesday night DJ nights, especially when I was manning the iTunes - artwork from the Dirt Farm- the bear and the bunny, always talking about something- did I mention the fried things?Basically, I feel like the Hut was the closest thing to Cheers that my fiance and I have experienced so far. Lary set us up with a DJ night that turned out to also be our going away party last month, and while I was sad at the end of the night, I left with a smile on my face at the memory of Bill and the other bartender yelling their best wishes after us.
If you already know the people who frequent this place, this is a place for you. I came here for their September karaoke night and got a vibe like I was an outsider looking in. Everyone seemed to already know each other, and didn't seem interested in meeting new folks.I was nervous as it is before going up to sing, and the chardonnay I had did little to help ease my nerves (though it was good) and the inhalation of all that secondhand smoke didn't help either. My voice was wan and only two people paid attention during the two times I went up to sing. I guess I wasn't as entertaining as the loud, drunk girl who was wearing a pirate eye patch.Though I didn't have a 100\% great time here I managed to enjoy myself, singing along with songs I knew and cheering on people who were bold enough to make asses of themselves. Believe it or not I wouldn't mind going back, but after December 1 when Virginia restaurants go smoke-free. I need to breathe!
I wrote my first review of this place months ago, but I can't stop going to this place. I love it more and more all the time.One thing that I didn't mention in my last review was the jukebox. The jukebox there is awesome, it has music in it that you would be hard-pressed to find anywhere else in Arlington. Some of the artists featured on it include Animal Collective, Arctic Monkeys, Beck, The Clash, Misfits, R.E.M., The Specials. There are so many more, those are just the few that I could recall at the moment. The jukebox is $.50 per song credit. For $1.25, you can make your song skip all of the others in the queue and play first.Also, all of the art in there is pretty cool and it is all for sale, or already sold, and waiting to be replaced by something new by the same artist. His name is Ben Claassen (bendependent.com) and his art is an essential part of the Galaxy Hut.I recently started going to events there which are typically on Sunday and Monday nights. I've seen some really great bands there and there's only a $5 cover to see them. A really helpful resource for anyone interested in going to events there is their myspace (myspace.com/galaxyhut) they post the event calendar there.I've tried some new food too. I've had the cheese steak, the chili, and the chic-n-chips. I normally get the chic-n-chips now, it's about $7 or $8. It comes with two pretty large pieces of breaded and fried chicken breast, your choice of fries or tots (i always get tots), and your choice of dipping sauce (i can't remember all of the options, but i always get honey mustard). All of the food that I've had there has been really good. It's always fresh, the kitchen is open and you can watch them cook it for you. The staff there are all really great. I go there more often now and I tend to meet different staff members based on what night I'm there. They're all really friendly and they're the kind of people who remember your name after only talking to you once. To be completely honest, I haven't meet a single staff member here who wasn't extremely friendly and helpful. I'm not sure how they do it everyday lol.So remember, good beer, good music, good art, good live performances, good food, and good people. Go there and see for yourself!
I took 1 star away from Galaxy Hut last year due to the smoke - I'm a little late on changing this, but since VA passed the smoking ban, I'm giving Galaxy Hut a full 5 stars.What an amazing beer selection. I went yesterday and didn't find a singe macro-brew on their draft list - what a wonderful change! The drafts are very reasonably priced for the quality of the beer, and you get $1 off during happy hour. The pricing isn't amazing or anything, but you come here for the selection.I had the Bluegrass Brewing Company's Jefferson's Reserve Bourbon Stout which was great. Unfortunately, with 20 beers on tap (including 13 or 14 which I've never had), there's no way I'll get through their full selection before some more beers rotate. Awesome food - chicken cheese steak, regular cheese steak, and the chili mac are delicious. On a side note, I'm kinda confused by the 2 hipsters with cans of PBR that sat down as I was leaving... with the great beers on tap & in bottle, why in the world would you choose PBR?

Thank you DC Yelp Rap for bringing me to Galaxy Hut, a place I *probably* would have never discovered otherwise. LIke Ol' Yella's review, I don't live anywhere near this hole in the wall drinking nook nor do I have any friends that frequent here. In fact, even though it's on Wilson Blvd., it's easy to drive by and miss it. I walk-in and begin looking around for my lyrical maestros...but not before taking a pit stop to the bathroom and bar (in that order respectively). There is only one bathroom for women, so I await patiently for a bit and look who pops out - the notorious Tina R. who shot me a huge smile and a polite "excuse me!" How delightful...is that really her? In this moment however, my concerns are redirected back to my bladder. I handle my business, and then head to the bar. I order a jack and coke...but turns out I didn't get the memo that only beer and wine are served here. Minus 3 cool points for me. So I order a lager on tap at the dimly lit bar and walk outside to see where my Yelpers were in the hizoouuuse! As I'm headed outside, I take it all of the awesome, quirky, cartoon art on the walls. Love it!So I head outside and find all my fellow Yelpers in this tin, hut looking structure where all the Yelpers are tucked away cozily. We all sat around the table in this aluminum hut and kicked it for a lil while we brainstormed all kinds of awesome ideas.Very unique place overall - mellow, off-beat, a lil gritty but still very cozy.
Galaxy Hut, I added another star, your cheap, cold and vast beer selection, friendly staff, eclectic art and usual cast of characters has won me over and I can walk home! Having this place so close to my house really makes me happy, each time I go here, I fall deeper and deeper in love, the small gerrymandered outdoor patio adds to the charm of this local hot spot. This is kind of place where you can saddle up to the bar all by yourself and leave with a lot of friends! Oh Galaxy Hut, you are so good to me.
I've never eaten here. It is an intimate space to hear bands on their American journey. Seating is a pain if you don't get there early. I love the sight of one band packing their wagon or van as another band unloads for the next show. They come from all over, Boston, Austin, you name it. Come out and support independent music.
Been going to the hut for 5+ years. Definitely my favorite dive in Arlington. Those of you reading this review are probably drunk already so I'll simplify this for you. Pros:-Always a good selection of beers on tap that you won't find anywhere else nearby-Alley seating is great.-Likely to find/meet Arlington locals.-Pretty good jukebox-They have tater-tots on the menuCons:-Bathrooms are rank as hell (I'm pretty sure this is required of any good dive)- A tad small (otherwise known as cozy or charming)Enjoy!
Come for the tots, stay for the sweet arcade table games.
Have yet to try the grilled cheese but I hear it's a must. Chill vibe.Hard to spot a bitton-down in the house.You know I'll be seeing you again.
I'm a little embarrassed that I have never been to Galaxy Hut until last night. It's a great dive bar located down the road from the more trendy bars in Clarendon. Awesome selection of beers, great art on the walls and friendly bar staff. It's very small (has a capacity of 50) and the crowd had a cool vibe. I'm certainly going to be back! Loved the video games - Pac Man! Also found it unique that they had patrons queue up to order drinks at the bar - funny, but useful for this small establishment.The only downside (which can be an upside for some folks) is that they allow smoking in the bar. Well, until Virginia tells the bars not to anymore.
Awesome, laid-back bar with a fantastic selection of beers. There's always something new on tap very week. It can get a bit cramped, especially on Thursdays and Fridays, so get there early if you want to sit. Has a nice, pub-like feel and you can tell why there are a lot of regulars. Great grilled cheese sandwiches too.
Fun place, nice alley bar. Bring cash, drink beer, and listen up close and personal to a band or two.
An unassuming establishment across from the Whole Foods in Arlington. The facility is not big, consisting of less than a dozen tables and some outdoor seating in the narrow alleyway.I would describe the ambiance as if you had put together a gathering of 50 acquaintances of thirty-somethings, add a good variety of choice Belgian and craft beers and toss in a karaoke and you've got yourself a formula for a fun and raucous evening without the hormone laden immaturity of a certain Alexandria karaoke bar that shall remain nameless. The food offering looks like it's whatever can be deep fried and drenched in a sauce. But you came here for the relaxing atmosphere and good drinks right?
I came here last night for some drinks. it was a good time.I really like how this place has the ability to detract the d-bag crowd. Always a good time, even better when we can get a table. The place is small but that's okay. The beer here is top notch. from Chimay to Duvall to some crazy raspberry shit that my sister got. It actually tasted like raspberries, WEIRD.Music isn't too loud where it gets annoying. If you like beer, then this my friend is heaven.
Me likey.I wish there was more seating, as it can get pretty tight in there, but overall a really cool bar. Galaxy Hut has really cool decor and the bartenders are friendly. So un-douchey it's AWESOME!!!
If you're looking for a laid-back bar with over 18 beers on tap, that is smokey, filled with hipsters..... this is your place. I love Galaxy for the freaky/interesting art, Pac Man video games, and friendly bartenders. My friends and I ordered a pitcher of Blue Point Blueberry Ale- absolutely delicious. I can't comment on the food. Side note: they don't serve liquor here, but who cares!
Between the Courthouse and Ballston stops on the Orange Line, lies this hidden gem. Located on a block that includes: a whole foods, bicycle shop, kebab place, gelato place, and a farmer's market...this area is no doubt a holy site for the local white people of the area. This place instantly reminded me of my favorite bar in my current city of Spokane, Washington ("The Baby Bar"). Atmosphere is incredibly laid back, with a great crowd. Lots of mid-twenty to early-thirty types. The extreme yuppies and raging, cackling queens present at other DC-area bars seem to be absent here, which I appreciated. I suck at making friends, and I actually made a good one here! (was in town on business for a week).Amazing beer on tap, including Dogfish Head Palo Santo Marron which the bar tender was VERY excited about...I wasn't sure if she was going to be OK or not for a second. (but seriously what's with almost every bar in the DC area dedicating half their tap handles to Belgians? Give me more microbrews please!) The food looked a little...below average, but I won't judge because: A) I didn't taste any of it B) This place isn't about the food C) East West Grill (see my review) is just one block down, eat there first!
I love going to this bar.I usually go right around happy hour, so I can't comment on the high volume crowds when bands are there, but my reasons for my infatuation are listed below:1) it's small2) they constantly have new beers on tap and in bottles3) I work on my fluidity via a sit down pac man machine4) they have a Galaga machine 5) the artwork on the wall is of painted humanoid rabbits with funny sayings atop them6) the bartenders are friendly as hell7) there is an outdoor area8) It's not your cookie cutter Clarendon barI can go on and on.  You need to experience this place.
An excellent and essential bar, catering to the indie crowd in the heart of Clarendon. Has the best selection of beers anywhere I have been in Arlington, including rare, regional brews and the selection seems updated fairly regularly. The interior is one of the best parts about the place, really fun artwork and just a great vibe overall. Cool jukebox. Bartenders have personality and have always been very friendly. There's a small patio area which is nice if you can grab a seat there. This should definitely be the main port of call in Arlington for anyone who is interested in decent music, art, or just a relaxed vibe, rather than popped collars or Dewey Beach cover bands, which is the scene that dominates the rest of the area. To be honest, I'm not even sure I would notice this place in a decent city like New York or Philly, but it is truly a breath of fresh air in Arlington.I can't comment on the food, which I've heard from friends is mediocre at best, or the live music, which I can only imagine makes the very small space feel even more crowded. The only issue I have is that it can get very crowded on Fri and Sat nights and there only ever seems to be 1 bartender, which can mean actually having to wait outside the door to get a drink. Overall, that is a small gripe for a very cool, and much needed bar in Clarendon.
Great artsy decor, paintings, people, beer selection, etc. Galaxy Hut is pretty dope and I'm looking forward to going back. It does get a little crowded and loud with social chatter, but I believe this is due to the fact that this bar is in a class of its own for the Arlington area. I mean, cummon! How many bars have you gone to and heard Bad Brains' Pay to Cum on the speakers? Fucking awesome!
Great bar. Hands down the best place to get a beer in Arlington and rivals a lot of places in DC. This bar reminds me of the best low key watering holes in southern California where you can really enjoy the company you're with or just hang out and observe those around you without being made to feel like a total dick. Super cool artwork, AMAZING beer selection on tap and fun people. I plan on going back soon to continue the tour of their hard-to-find-anywhere microbrews. Yelpers, rejoice!
It pains me to give this spot only three stars, as I worry about its future. Since Dr. Dremo closed, Galaxy Hut is the last of the "scuzzy but fun" bars in Clarendon. But Galaxy is just too damn small, and jamming a band or DJ into the space doesn't work. They'd be better off allowing guests to bring their iPODS in and have "iPOD nights." The place is too smoky (can't wait for December 1...), and the outdoor "patio" is a joke. Now, on the plus side, the bartenders are the friendliest in Arlington. Interesting people go to this place---more interesting than the obnoxious psychojock guys in flip flops, and shallow and dull Barbie doll girls at Clarendon Ballroom or Harry's Tap Room. The crowd here reminds me of Iota--both staff and patrons. Let's hope Galaxy doesn't go the way of Dremo. It would be a shame.
I'm officially a big fan of this place.I've been coming here off and on for a few years now and I can honestly say that the interesting and off-beat atmosphere here is unmatched in the area. My most recent visit with Keri M. and a few non-yelper friends and family has deepened my adoration of this inexplicably (and thankfully) under-visted arlington night spot. Fully operational Pac-Man and Galaga machines built into the tables? Oh yes. I'm still bad at both games (I know, I'm a child of the 80's who sucks at Pac-Man. Nerds, be gentle). Home grown local hipsters making up staff and clientele? Yup, and I can see why. There's an outstanding selection of [DRAFT!] microbrews and international beers. I'm not saying the beer selection is massive (though it is of decent size), but the quality of the beers they've chosen for their menu is just awesome. BBC Bourbon Stout, where have you been all my life?There's cool outdoor seating in the side alley, complete with a large semi-circular seating area built into a brewing vat that's been cut in half (not unlike the set up at the now defunct Dr. Dremo's). Somehow I've never had occasion to try the food, but honestly, they could slide me a styrofoam plate with a half-frozen hot pocket on it and it wouldn't diminish my opinion of this bar in the slightest.
This place is pretty solid. It's a hipster feeling den of beer and cigarette smoke, which I like, but no one is too obnoxious. Bill, the bartender, is a nice guy, but hates when you call him William and everyone else who works there is pretty easy going.I wish the place had more chairs, a little more space, and could expand its alleyway further back. It feels like the beginning of a Law & Order episode where the body is found and the theme starts. This is one of my favorite neighborhood places and hopefully it doesn't get pushed out like Dr. Dremos
nice dark atmosphere.attentive and nice staff.i ordered the grilled chicken sandwich which came with fries.pretty good.got some strawberry abita lagers. very good.thats all i have to say about that.
Of course I love the Hut! I've been coming here for the past, hmmm, well, a long time now. It's gone through some transitions, ups and downs, but it is still one of my top favorite places to go to just chill and talk and have a happy time during the week. I used to come here so I could write and *go out* at the same time (go figure), but with the ever-booming Arlington territory, it is too crowded most of the time to be able to secure an entire booth for myself and write anymore.The people are allll different types, usually bordering on the quirkier side of things. The beer selection is splendid. They don't serve liquor ( but who needs it when you can get a 9\% alc. Saint Pete's?!) and the wine selection is meager. There's a small patio and a silo transformed into a sitting area. There's even Galaga! Even if you're the shyest, most introverted person in the world, you will somehow find yourself talking to someone. Despite the recent, ever-persisting infiltration of the douchebag population, this place is bound to make you smile.Lastly, the staff are just amazing people and a top reason for my continued patronage. Love you guys! Cheers!
I took a glance at some of these reviews before I went to Galaxy Hut with a friend the other night, so my expectations were quite high. I was pleasantly surprised to find that it more than lived up to the hype! All night long I was drinking beers that I had never heard of, because most of what they had on tap was micro or less common imports. It reminds me a lot of the Quarry House in Silver Spring, in that it is super chill and has lots of drink variety. Good people, good environment. Galaxy Hut is nice because you don't really have to plan for it - mentally, I mean. You can just go there after work or on a casual night out and not worry about anything because you are pretty much guaranteed to have a good time. Definitely check this place out.
Arriving at 6pm after work on a Tuesday, the only table free was the one right next to the line to order drinks. This was a convenient spot, both for ordering without getting up and making conversation with just about everyone else in the bar who was ordering a drink. The variety and selection of beers is great, and the fact that they will give you a sample before you request it is really a time saver on the express train to awesometown. The cheesesteak was good, and most of the other menu items looks to cover standard bar faire.The crowd was good, with lots of indie "kids" and other accepting folk. The comments from the beer line were pithy, sexual, and downright enjoyable. I didn't smell "the axe effect" all night, refreshing. The environment also lends itself well to the more eccentric, with interactive wall art and classic table top video games. The bathrooms remind me of clubs in NYC, except cleaner with higher ceilings. The crowd really takes off after 10p, especially if there is music. They do allow smoking inside; the smell you can remember all the way into tomorrow through you clothes. Unless you're sitting next to an old woman smoking Virginia Slim Menthols, you'll manage. There is a threshold to how many people can be in the bar before it becomes too claustrophobic to handle, but just plan ahead; make sure you've had three or four pints before that threshold.I'm going back!
I dig Galaxy Hut.  Great beers on tap, super unpretentious and huge pitchers. I wouldn't recommend making a meal of the place but they do have barfood standards. Any place with Delirium Tremors on tap works for me. It can get crowded here, so if you come a little bit early, you should be good for a seat.
Excerpt from a conversation I had about Galaxy Hut:"Stephanie, I know the perfect bar for you to visit. The beer selection is excellent, the decor has that dingy indie-charm, and the guys are generally non-predacious. The local bands are kind of hit or miss, but the cover is only $5. Also, if you're still vegetarian, the menu has some tasty vegan dishes, mostly faux meats."Galaxy Hut is a nice bar. Way too crowded on the weekends to enjoy myself anymore, but I still go when I want a dark belgian ale on tap. The beer selection doesn't get stagnant, they usually switch it up once a month (if not more). The beer lis can be found on the website too. Everyting from IPAs to belgian ales to hard ciders at times.  Nothing in terms of liqour, but that probably keeps the suits and frat boys away (though they do have one tap for miller lite, the champagne of bros). Also, you can still smoke here, as my 'smoking jacket for the non-smoker' is a testament. The bartenders are friendly when there isn't a rush. Don't be shy, they don't mind giving you samples of their various draft beers (I dodged a pint of terrible chocolate raspberry stout this way). Also, i've never had my order messed up here, no matter what the rush or a one-man kitchen. Definitely solid service. Prices here are good. I think happy hour is 5-8pm, which is $1 off drafts? Regardless, the selection makes it worthwhile.Though there are quieter bars with similar selections, I have yet to find a place where indie music, Duvel, and a giant burger mash-up so well.
great laid-back vibe, fantastic service, friendly people, awesome old-school video games.
It's a small place but the food is great, the atmosphere is very low-key and the beer selection is awesome. Too bad it's always freaking crowded!!!
I don't consider myself a regular, but I do consider myself to be old school in that I've been frequenting the Galaxy Hut since I became "legal" 11 years ago. I would consider old school to be those that went to the Hut before the area exploded in to another a land where the Cheesecake Factory is acceptable for a Friday night. As times changed for the area, in a bland way, the Galaxy Hut needs to get with the times as far as atmosphere. Listen, I respect a person's right to smoke and I also realize those things are still supporting a certain percentage of Virginia's economy, but it's time to take them outside. The argument that a lot of people won't come if smoking is banned is ridiculous. "What is that decision making like. Well, I can't smoke in this building so my ass is just going to stay on this chair and I'm going to have me a little smoke party or I'm going to go to this total wack place down the street that allows me to smoke." The beer selection is great, the art is interesting, there are good bands and even video games and good food; I just don't want to go home smelling like the draggin' lady. That's the one change they need to make. Please don't make the government have to legislate that for us.
Yeah, I like Galaxy Hut. Good beer selection, couple of good table top video games, good music. Once it gets packed it can be a little annoying, but that doesn't happen very often, so I wouldn't worry about it. I mean, look, if you're even a little indie rock you have to come here. Make what you will of that.
more like galaxy butt, as in cigarette butt, as in smoke filled, as in disgusting.next time i get the urge to hang out inside of an ashtray filled with a bunch of non descript chatches and d-bags, i'll be heading back to this place.
This bar is perfect. I had to move away to Brooklyn and have not been able to find anything quite like it. It is a small place, so it can get smokey, crowded, and loud inside on weekends. If it looks crowded, check out their patio, which is an alley with murals, awnings, and a converted grain silo. Drinking in an alley is actually more pleasant than your mother may have led you to believe. The small size indoors makes it a very convivial space though, and it is a comfortable place to go and sit at the bar to meet new people when it is less busy. The bartenders are great people and the beers are the best you will find in the area. It is the defacto place to hold a birthday gathering. Think of it as Chuck E Cheese with belgian beers and chainsmoking, at least until the smoking ban kicks in. I've only seen someone get hit by a flying cupcake once or twice there, so it usually works out OK. Anyway, the vibe of the bar represents the last remains of the Arlington of the 1990s, when Arlington was cheaper to live in (under $700 for a two bedroom apartment.) and there were a decent numbers of musicans and arty-farty people. There was a great music scene around several labels and group houses. A lot of great touring bands used to come through. Then condos sprung up everywhere, the developers drove off the unicorns, the Vietnamese community got priced out and mostly moved to Eden Center, Ian MacKaye got old, puppies and rainbows were banished, and it became unaffordable to live there unless you are working for the man doing something boring.
good beer and nice people.
Ahh Galaxy hut. An island of divey hipsterdom (but not in a trying-too-hard way) in a sea of yuppie sameness. Spectacular beer selection: this is the only place I've ever seen Delerium Tremens and Victory Golden Monkey (two of my favorites) on tap. The tap selection changes frequently. There are 3 old school arcade tables, my gambling prone buddy and I often get drunk and end up playing Galaga for 20 bucks a game. The only downside is that the place is tiny. If you show up in a group of 4 after 9 or so on a Friday, you are gonna be standing, and there ain't much room to stand.
Great for what it is, if you don't mind being completely uncomfortable any time you visit. You can't blame the place for the size of its space, and a place with this good of a beer selection and unpretentious of atmosphere (or very pretentious, its just that its the kind of people who call other people pretentious; reverse pretentiousness I suppose). I like the place, its just that everyone does, and that means you'll have a hard time fitting in there, and the option of standing doesn't really exist either, but that's clarendon for you, if there is any place worth going to its way too crowded.Go for the beer, try to go on a weeknight or odd hour, and enjoy yourself. Good place to just hang out, and the food is edible, I can't say much more than that at this point, as I've only eaten there once. Oh, and the service is very good, good beer, good service, just a bit uncomfortable.
I love this spot. As a girl who is happiest at the bars in Haight Street, I can really appreciate a bar that's not pretentious AND has great beer!
I was skeptical when my friend suggested that we go out in Clarendon (not really my scene), but this place is a real gem. I can not type another sentence without commenting on how awesome the music was. A bar that unpretentiously appreciates the goodness of In Rainbows will top my list any day. It's a small place with limited tables, but it keeps the numbers down so you can actually have a conversation. Looking for a hip place for a first date? This is your place. A night out with a group of good friends? This is your place. The extensive beer list is like that place in Dupont minus the college crowd. The food is casual barfare but what is neat is that every option has a veggie option.
The name alone brings to mind the trekky geeks and d&d nerds from middle school - well guess what? This is where they hang out. Except...Remember that loner kid who juggled hacky sacks during lunch? That's the unassuming hottie in the corner. Yes... now, they aren't losers anymore - they are cute, hipster and have somehow managed to hold onto their personality/humor through their taunted high school years.This place has an impressive collection of beer, but you can get that all around the city. Honestly, the chase in Ms. PacMan gives me anxiety, so that's not why i come either. THIS place is unique because of the crowd. - I have never failed to strike up an interesting conversation with a seemingly genuine person here. Genuine?? Yes, it exists, even in the DC area. Also - I'm throwing Bassey E's next birthday party here ;) Wanna come?!
Been here a couple of times. It's quite different than most bars in the Clarendon area. Firstly, they allow smoking. Secondly, the music leans towards the Emo side rather than the 80's dance remix so common in Clarendon. Lastly, the beer selection is very good, and although I haven't eaten there, the IPA cooked hot dogs caught my eye. Bottom line--if you want to have a smoke (or don't mind others), want a great beer selection, and lean towards the Emo/punk side of the music spectrum than this is your place. Normally, I'd only give it three stars because of the small size and smokiness, but the beer selection is worth an extra star.
If it's your first time walking into Galaxy Hut, don't be offended if you feel like the music suddenly stopped and everyone has turned to look at you.This place is an Arlington oasis, and the regulars don't take too kindly to the curious gawkers. If you want to watch football and high-five your friends while dancing to 80's music, go to Front Page.If you like an insane selection of beer and Mrs. Pac Man, Galaxy Hut is for you. The tables are made from old school games that you can play while drinking and pretending to listen to your friend's whining. It's dark and there's a weird smell so this place definitely isn't trying to impress anyone. It's as hipster and indie as Arlington gets. In fact, now that Dreamo's is gone, I'm sure this place is Mecca to Arlington's tattoo sleeves and skinny jeans. I've been sporadically in the rain and sunshine, in the summer and winter, at day and night. One word: consistent. Nothing changes, not even the bartender--who I believe is the owner but I could be wrong. The hot dogs are tastey--nothing phenomenal, but the beer-only choices make up for it. It's a cheap and solid establishment. Sometimes they have live music, and rumor has it they pull down a screen for movies every once in a while.
I give it 5 stars for a weekday. It's a great place to have a tasty beer or two and chat with some friends, and it's not incredibly hard to get a table. To balance that out, however, I give it 1 star for weekends. It's crowded enough that the only way it would be tolerable would be if you were falling-down drunk, but the place is far too expensive to consider putting yourself in that state there.As far as the beer selection goes, I find that they tend to stray from the standard beer bar tradition of carrying an veritable ton of IPAs. This works out well for me, because as much as I love IPAs, the noise of women complaining about how much they hate hoppy beer really cuts significantly into my enjoyment. The selection really has something for everyone - they really do quite a good job with it.So, they have a great beer selection, but you certainly pay for what you get in all instances. There aren't really any values to be had here - lots of 20 dollar pitchers. Since it's so hard to get a beer, there isn't even a discount when you do buy a pitcher. I suppose you're expected to just be happy with the fact that your beer is easier to carry around. I've never had the food here.
After having spent multiple nights at Galaxy Hut, a diamond in the rough of DC-area nightlife, I'm ready to declare it my favorite bar in the city. One of the best beer selections in the area, and good prices as well. I was astounded when I was able to get a full-sized pitcher of Delirium for $28. First, pitchers of Delirium? Never knew that was possible. Second, $28? That's cheaper than the store-bought variety. The jukebox is limited to tasteful rock selections (e.g. Bloc Party, Radiohead) and set at a volume level that allows for actual conversation. The bartenders are friendly and knowledgeable about the beer they offer -- ready to make a poignant recommendation when prompted. And, perhaps best of all, the people who populate this small neighborhood bar all seem to have made the choice to venture to this little hole-in-the wall deliberately. A recent reviewer appropriately characterized Galaxy Hut as a refuge from "douchebag central." I agree. This bar somehow manages to be extremely pretentious in a non-pretentious way (something that The Saloon -- another great beer location on U street -- unfortunately fails at miserably). Offering a beer-only bar, a music selection limited to "indie rock" style tunes, and a specially designated zone for ordering drinks could (and usually would) be a turnoff and a sign that a place was trying too hard to be exclusive. But Galaxy Hut never makes you feel unwelcome (even though the cigarette smoke can be a bit stifling). I'll be seen at this spot frequently from here on out.
This is a mellow neighborhood bar. Their strong point is beer. I am not the biggest beer drinker, so this probably would never be on my regular rotation for that reason alone. There was a long beer menu, and you could order in different sizes. A tip for 1st timers: walk in and get in line. There is an arrow. Stand near the arrow and order a beer, then go sit somewhere. There's no waiter service and there's no lining up all along the bar to get drinks.
In every metropolitan area there is an area that is known as "douchebag central." In the San Francisco Bay Area, it is the Marina District in San Francisco. I've been told that in the DC Metro area, it is Arlington. Somehow, Galaxy Hut didn't get the memo.Awesome beer selection. As a West Coaster, I was very pleasantly surprised with finding Bear Republic's Racer Five IPA and a few selections from the Anderson Valley Brewing Company. Both are Northern California Microbrews. It's hard to find these beers outside of California, let alone the other side of the country.There was good music played, mostly punk, and it was never loud to the point that conversation was impossible. Very smoky though, but I'm not in California anymore.
I knew this was going to be a fun chill place because of the friend who brought me here. I can't believe I never came here during the 6 months I lived in Ballston - why did I waste my time at Front Page and Rock Bottom (ohhhh the days of being an Arlington Girl).Galaxy Hut is super fun and chill. They have an awesome beer list and friendly bar tenders. The downside is that since it's in VA, you can smoke there. I guess since it's in VA, you coud also carry a gun in there. Sometimes I'm so glad I live in California.
Galaxy Hut is a good place to go on quiet nights. They have a great selection of beers that really show the manager cares about the brewdogs. The walls are decorated with Ben Heck's great art from his Dirt Farm comic strip. They also have a retro 80's arcade game that doubles as a table.Unfortunately, the space is limited, seating is rare, and the place gets hot when it gets crowded. Expanding into the next door space would be a godsend someday for Galaxy Hut. For the time being, if you get there early and get a seat, you are going to have a beerlicious night.
Overpriced, crowded nerd bar full of wanna-be hipsters. Looks like the set for an 80's glam rock music video, sans the actual glam rock. Pass.
3.25 stars. First and foremost, I love the oddball artwork that adorns the walls at Galaxy Hut. The reading dolphin, the crazy unidentifiable thing drinking the milk, and the movable art piece are probably my favorites. It reminds me of places I used to go in Austin, TX (Crown & Anchor, Longhorns, etc.) and this is undoubtedly a good thing. The beer list is extensive and changes on nearly a weekly basis. I have been here a few times, but I have unfortunately always missed the live performances. The crowd is an indie as you are going to get in Arlington, VA. Great spot for a couple of beers on a low-key evening.
I LOVE THIS PLACE!I discovered this place through the now defunct "DC Punk & Hardcore" meetup group. I am so glad that I went to that one event before it died. This has to be my favorite pub of all time. It's totally a place where all of the former punk kids hang out and live out their sellout (assuming they were "edge" at some point).The beer selection is great - tons of microbrews from all around and it's a great price. Bring friends and get a pitcher for sure!When it's warm, try the "deck" it's basically boards built up over the alley between their building and the next - perfect for the decor. And if your huge group of 10+ can get it, the "suite" at the back of the deck is one of a kind.The atmosphere is dark, chill and fun. Cartoons and paintings adorn the walls and there are even vintage video game tables to sit at.Great place for sure!
Though from Boston, I visit VA to see my son who is a student at GMU. My son and his friend insisted I go to this place with them, and honestly, I cringed at the thought of being "mom" in a college frat bar with a bunch of horny and drunken amateur night stumblers, mindlessly whooping it up all around me. In addition, being an old punk rock diver from the early days, I wasn't expecting to find a place that would live up to the casual indie bar atmosphere from that era. Even in Boston/Cambridge, they are hard to come by these days. Galaxy Hut changed all this. Simultaneously hearing Mission of Burma followed by Gang of Four on the jukebox, while checking out the excellent beer and food selection, made me fall in love with this place. I was also impressed with the diversity of style and age of the patrons. Everyone at this place was totally cool because they were not trying to be.  Shock... I felt totally comfortable. The beer selection is excellent. Though we didn't order food, the menu was simple and well presented. Being vegan, I was impressed by the veggie and vegan selections they offered. Though, I had to laugh at the "vegan chili with cheese" (or something like that) offering. The jukebox is excellent. The game tables were a kick. The staff were laid back and friendly. I am recommending this place to any of my casual pub goer friends who are paying a visit to the VA/DC area. The GH most definitely added some flair to the last night of my Christmas holiday visit.
A little piece of the lower east side, south. Minus the ventilation issues, it feels as though the price is right, the selection is superb and the vibe is comfortable.
Galaxy Hut is a really comfortable bar with great beer and good food and pleasant bartenders who seem to like their job.I just want to say that, contrary to the tone of the majority of the posts here, you don't need a "scenester/indie-rock membership card" to go to Galaxy Hut. It's a neighborhood bar that people can be into on a lot of levels.My band played there last year and we had a great time. The bartender was also the soundperson, and even in a small place I thought the levels were fine. She also knew a lot about the beer she was pouring, which was cool and something you don't see, even at a place known for its selection like the Brickskeller.
I second, or fourth, or sixteenth what everyone else has already said! Laid-back atmosphere, good beers, cool crowd. I always enjoy myself here.
One word:MozzarellaSticks
I'm so glad Galaxy Hut exists in Arlington. Great for relaxing, no one is there to show off, great beer selection. I got to sit at the ms. pac man table which made me very happy since it is my favorite video game! I really liked the crowd, but was confused by the big group of people wearing pink argyle and carrying a variety of golf clubs and such...sorority/fraternity meet up or something? Anyway go to galaxy hut if you want to hang out and have a beer in a relaxed setting, but not if you want to get dressed up and show off your goods or check out other peoples goods (at least that's the impression I got).
I loooove this place. I'm not a big drinker but I like to come here with friends for the laid back atmosphere. What I absolutely love about this place is that it never takes itself too seriously, unlike the yuppie over-pretentious clubs in dc or down the street at clarendon ballroom. I've always had a great time here just relaxing, laughing, and putting back a couple of beers from a really good selection. The only problem is that it may get crowded because the place is pretty small. Other than that I definitely recommend this place.
Very cool, laid back bar near Clarendon/Court House. An EXCELLENT selection of beers. What else can I say? Its not a huge place, but the booths are perfect for about 4 people. They have some tables in the center and some seating in the alley to the side. The bartenders are friendly. The art/comics on the walls are hilarious and/or interesting. 5 stars mainly for having such an excellent beer selection. Try the bourbon flavored stout!
The music there can be pretty loud. It's a tiny space. Bring earplugs and make sure you are going to like the music playing or at least tolerate it, there is no way to escape it. It's one room. And loud. This is a typical band night for me there...Jacob: What?!! Me: I can't hear you!!!Jacob: What??! Oh yeah? (feigning comprehension)Me: Let's play Pacman!! Jacob: OK.
I love you for what you almost are. You are the closest thing to an SF dive bar that I've found in DC. I suppose it isn't fair to expect SF when I'm not in SF, but it really is cooler. Even in SF I would love this place. They don't overcharge for shows like you-know-who across the street. Juke box has great tunes. Galaga and Pac Man rock my world (although I suck). Beer selection is stellar. Albeit a tad small, I would argue that's part of the charm. Clarendon sorority girls stay out!
What a fun bar. After Dr. Dremo's closed, I frequent this place a lot more often. A good selection of beer makes for an exciting and different evening. The place is alternately crowded, yet friendly. I knock a star off because (and this is entirely subjective) the entire place is a little too small. The "patio" is an alley with some small tables and sometimes you can wait a little bit to find a seat though that's not uncommon at any bar. Over all, I'd say this is one of my favorite bars in the area.
GH is a great place to hang out but it's a tad bit small. I like that they have beers that most other bars don't have. The happy hour makes it even better. The fries are the only food I've ever had here and they get my seal of approval. There is an "outside patio," but that's laughable. Just get here early to ensure you get a spot to sit.
Great hipster spot. They have a variety of beers on tap not often found at your run of the mill bar. Although, they tend to favor hoppy beers which give me headaches, but I won't dock a star for that, as many people like the hoppy beers.They also have a great indie music playing most of the time. And your fellow patrons tend to be younger, hipper, less mainstream folk. The regular bartender (I'm blanking on his name) is very friendly and attentive.I dock a star because it is smokey, no liquor, and their beers are always a little warmer than I'd like them to be... otherwise this would be a 5 star joint!
My go-to place for great draft beer, Pac Man, and a night out with the peeps. Slowly getting infiltrated by Whitlows clientele, this place still has some indie rock cred and is friendly, smokey, and doesn't serve liquor. the food is a bit pricey, but so far has not been awful. There is also a "secret" alley where you can sit outside.
The Galaxy Hut has been a part of my life forever, seemingly.The Hut made me the beer snob I am today. :)Can't miss in Clarendon. My old neighborhood may have a big ol' Barnes and Noble and a Cheesecake Factory and a Container Store that knocked out most of the other small businesses...but the Galaxy Hut (and my beloved Java Shack) still live on.
The most eclectic beer selection in Clarendon, and the coolest decor around. When you open the door, you definitely get the feel that you have walked into a place that is proud to be different than its Wilson Boulevard neighbors.It gets 5 stars in my book for offering something different to the Clarendon scene and being very good at it.
What can I say about G-Hut that hasn't been said - the place is one of a kind in a neighborhood that has changed so much in the past several years. Truly one of the last bastions of real Arlington. Excellent music, beer, and patrons.
"Right in the middle of fancy Clarendon" is how Maya L. describes the Galaxy Hut.....ah, but Maya, the Hut is just about the last remaining piece of the old-school unfancy quasi-hipster Clarendon of the '90s and early '00s (anyone remember Strangeways?), a Clarendon that was almost a mini-Brooklyn (someone else on here made a fairly accurate comparison to Enid's in Greenpoint, one of my Brooklyn favorites). Lots of delicious microbrews on tap and the greatest "patio" ever -- an alley with a mural of a psychotic clown!
Drinking in Arlington/Clarendon makes me feel like I'm in New Jersey. And, yes, that's a slam. The Galaxy Hut makes me feel like I'm in Brooklyn. As a matter of fact, it reminds me of my old local, Enid's, in Greenpoint. And that, my friends, is a ringing endorsement.It's a tavern: no booze here, no fancypants infused-lavender-foam geegaws to sully the bar, no gold-diggers looking for their lawyer/doctor meal-ticket, and no frat boys looking for their next conquest.It's for purists, indie rockers and smokers. Which is why the Hut is such a gem. As for the smoke complaints: cigarettes and beer go together like Homer and donuts. Those of you that can't deal with that, well, you've got a thousand other places you can go - just leave us the Hut and keep your trap shut.Play some Galaga! Laugh at the hysterical paintings by Ben Claassen of DirtFarm comic strip fame! Cruise out to the patio! Try the umpteen different beers available! Eat a hot dog with extra kraut! Wonder where all the indie rockers hide when they're not at The Hut!It's fun.
AWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWESOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOME.Awesome. Awesome awesome awesome.I've been looking for a decent bar since I got here. And I finally found it. Excellent outsider-type art on the walls, a killer cheeseburger (I had them put jalapenos on mine, because I kick ass), some damn impressive chili-cheese dogs, $3 PBRs, and Deerhoof in the jukebox.AND you can SMOKE there.This bar made me feel like I was home again. That fact clinched our decision to move to Arlington once our lease in shitty, shitty Ashburn is up. Thank you, Galaxy Hut.
galaxy hut is a tiny, tough, tangy, tasty treat.  it dont have to have an IPO to be your girl, it don't have to be a chain to rule your world, or even be over a hundred square feet. it can, and is, be owned by the bartender/musician/artist (larry) who bought it from the musician (alice) who owned it before him. it's got tasty vittles, some of them vegan, some meatful, all yum. (BRING BACK THE FREAKING BRUNCH). its got a sweet outdoor place, a jukebox, live and intriguing music a few nights a week for a tiny cover charge, patrons who aren't as lame as the rest of arlington. and you can trek back and forth between the hut and iota, and pretend the world hasn't been sold to the highest bidder (Hi, Williams Sonoma!) , and there is more to a night out that irish bars (Hi RiRa! Hi Four Courts!) and bistros locally owned by artists can thrive (hi steve and jane and larry!) and funk and fun are still here, if only for a little while.
Great tap beer selection... retro table video games from the 80's... generally weird but, friendly atmosphere.Plenty of other bottles and cans of Pabst for those who don't like delicious Belgian and German beers on tap. Haven't tried the food. smelled good when I was hammered though.
love this place. cute and artsy decor... great beer selection... good music. nothing like what i would expect in a typical stuffy northern virginia bar. this place is down to earth, funky, and cool. love love.
I call this the hipster-indie rock music scene of Clarendon. They often have local bands perform, who are often quite good. They don't have a huge selection of beers on tap, but they have QUALITY beers on tap, which is more important. They have pacman and galaga (?) tabletop arcade games to play. (how cool is that?) I love the decor of the place, especially the giraffe in a space helmet. Could the artist paint that on my apartment wall?The only downside is the place is very small (max capacity is like 40) and gets smokey quickly.
I am very much in love with Galaxy Hut. I aspire to be even half as cool as it is. It really is tiiiiny - think tiny, and cut that room in half. But that's part of its charm, so I love it. It's open every night of the week. The old school arcade game tables are ingenious, and the bar staff is ready with change. They play great music and have a stacked jukebox. I'm a bourbon girl, but with the extensive varieties of beers both bottled and on tap (fifteen on tap!), I don't mind that they don't serve liquor - I wouldn't even want to hang with Jack or Jim! I've enjoyed a delicious blueberry beer on tap and had a couple bottles of a lovely Belgian raspberry ale. Nothing's too pricey, so I very much hope to make my way down their lists sooner than later. They've also got a few house wines. But all of that could fade and I'd still come back. The artwork all over the walls is reason enough to stop by in my book. It's quirky, funny, interesting, the kind of stuff you'd see on etsy or at a street art fair, if you're lucky. I want to steal everything and redecorate my room, especially the painting with the bunny and the bear talking about whatever *you* want via a bunch of interchangeable comic book-style talk bubbles that hang on the painting. So awesome.I haven't seen a show yet, but I love the idea of settling into this cozy little place for a night with some talented, but probably not-so-well-known musicians. Shows are Sundays, Mondays and select Saturdays, for just a $5 cover after 930pm. And no live music, no cover - no complaints! Yeah, that little room can get pretty smokey, but it's VA, so unless I find a place exactly like this in DC, I'll deal while I drink delightful beers and gaze longingly at sweet artwork. While I was hesitant to sing its praises bc I don't want it to get too crowded, if any bar deserves Yelpy praise, it's Galaxy Hut. Check it out and develop your own crush. But if you come by one night and the usually colorful walls are bare and sad, don't say I didn't warn you...
Really neat place with an excellent selection of draft beer....particularly whatever variety of Rogue they have at the moment. Don't be afraid to ask the bartender for a recommendation or a sample of a beer that draws your attention. Haven't seen live music here (as of this month, predominately on Sun/Monday) , but imagine it'd be a cozy, fun spot for it.
Definitely come here for the beers on tap - stay for the "cozy-punk" atmosphere. If it feels like your having a cigarette in your friends basement while reading comics or playing arcade games. (Yes, they have Galaga as a table top arcade game. It's awesome. Bring lots of quarters.) The food is pretty decent but remember this place packs up quick and if there's a band playing you might not make it in because it gets packed - so get there around 9-ish. Larry is a really cool bartender too. Parking isn't a problem b/c it's right by the courthouse or the clarendon metro. Bathrooms are small but...it's a bar. :)
If I lived in Clarendon and had a higher tolerance for ample cigarette smoke trapped in a relatively small space, I'd make Galaxy Hut my designated hangout spot. But even as it is, I always enjoy nestling into a table in this dim, well-decorated spot (think twinkly yellow Christmas lights and ubercute illustrations of giraffes and dolphins) and sharing a pitcher of one of their dozen or so fantastic, reasonably priced beers with friends (Allagash white! Numerous Belgian things!), while the jukebox doles out song after song that prompts exclamations of delight. To top it off, unlike some bars in the area, the crowd is entirely un-fratty and, I'd dare say, refreshingly leaning toward the older, nerdier, SideKick/iPhone-toting demographic.
I love this place. Great ambiance, great beer selection, great music. the interior is kind of small, but in good weather there's an outdoor alley seating area that's well-kept secret. They have old school table-top video games, a killer jukebox, and some of the best conversationalist patrons in the area. Try to catch a live show during the week, the intimate atmosphere makes it something not to be missed!
Great beers of different varieties. Funky atmosphere, too. I think the artwork is cool and original.
What can I say that hasn't been said before in another review? My favorite bar in the DC area, and I used to live a short walk away. Score. It's where the indie locals are; I was wondering where they were hiding. Love karaoke night, or live music nights with an assortment of indie bands from all over that you've never heard of but that have myspace pages :).Now if only Arlington would do away with smoking...because the ventilation isn't that great in such a small building. Plus I'd love to see some liquor someday...but beggars can't be choosers. Galaxy Hut was my small little indie neighborhood bar.
I was physically assaulted by a crazy woman claiming to be an employee at Galaxy Hut. I wrote to the newish owner, bartender Larry, and never heard back.
So I suppose I shouldn't dock the place a star for my sorely-lacking-in-video-games childhood, but I could easily spend too much time playing space invaders or pinball on the tables instead of actually talking to the people I'm hanging out with. It's a very chill bar -- at least on the night we went, and I so can't remember what day of the week it was -- with an awesome hefe on tap.I wasn't too keen on the music/guitarist that night, but hey, at least it was free live entertainment! Apparently they charge cover some nights. (I heard it used to be busier/with better music during previous management -- but I don't know anything about it personally). We didn't get any food so I can't comment on that. I'll most likely be back with the friends who brought me there.
Awesome bar filled with cool people and a really nice selection of beers. Seen my share of live bands play there and talk about an intimate setting - you basically have to wait for them to finish playing a song so you can squeeze through the front door LOL! If reading this induces a claustrophobic panic attack, try going during a weeknight when it's calmer :)
Hey, you! Yes, I'm talking to you. Tired of the old quasi-euro-froo froo lounges and bars? Read below. Come over to Galaxy Hut. Once you open the door, you're no longer in Clarendon, and now in the LES of NYC. Leave your Nike dunks, $200 jeans, and all else that might give you away as "trying" to be hip. No Billionaires Boys Club apparel here. Dirty t-shirts, torn jeans, and flip-flops are welcome. The weekends are typically packed, with an agile twist here and there, you might be lucky to score a seat at the pacman arcade table.
Best bar in Clarendon so far. Even better than Jay's. Went on karaoke night, and it was surprisingly refreshing. Not because of the singing; it was in general pretty atrocious. But the song selection was interesting. Not what I expected, in a good way. And the best part about the karaoke was that everybody doing it and everybody listening seemed to really enjoy it. There's nothing sadder than karaoke when nobody's into it. Thankfully at Galaxy Hut it was the complete opposite of that. The clientele was not the usual Clarendon crowd and therefore was a breath of fresh air. The bartender was really nice, and they have a good beer selection. It's a fairly small bar, though we only stayed in the front part, but it's a cozy area of the bar. Best of all, they have three of those old table-top arcade video games from the 1980's. Three of 'em!! Pinball, Pacman, and Galaga. Nice. Taking me back to my nerdy childhood.I didn't stay long because it was late, but I will definitely be back. If you're tired of the usual corporate Clarendon, check this place out.
My new favorite bar in Clarendon. Great beer selection, laid back hipster clientele and fun, quirky, interactive art on the walls. Of note, a few of the tables appear to be old pinball machines. Karaoke night (Thursday) is pretty fun, with the regulars getting into it and dancing.
i've only been to the g-hut a few times, and i can't say i've ever had a bad time there. on the other hand, i can't say i've ever had a particularly fantastic time either. maybe you just have to know all the regulars? i'm not sure. but i do agree it feels cozy (it's a small space!) and a good place to get up close and personal with bands you like.
People, I won't lie. I'm a bit of a DC snob. And by that I mean I try to avoid Virginia as much as possible. But that may all change now...Galaxy Hut was great. Excellent beer selection, and an even more excellent Jukebox. Friendly bartender, cute patio, and a laidback crowd. I hear the food is good too, especially for vegetarians. Great place!
Wide select of beers and good grub. The staff is cool and can recommend the right beer for whatever mood you're in. Has a nice open ally and good music.
To this day, Galaxy Hut remains my favorite bar of all time. It's just so cozy. It's like Cheers with an indie rock soundtrack. Lary has done such an amazing job with fixing it up in the past couple years. Each time I make it back to the DC area, I always try to stop in and say hi to Lary and Bill. These guys are some of the sweetest you will ever meet. Actually, I rarely encounter jerks there. I wish I could clone the bar and bring it to Chicago, but then Arlington would lose its' greatest asset. I did one Hump Night there as one of my going away events, but I want to do another one sometime since it's the best, having a drink and playing music that you love for people you love...man, that's what it's all about.
One of the last "cool" places in Clarendon. There are some great beers on tap, many of which you will not find elsewhere. The beer menu changes, as the owner is a bit of an afficianado, so there's always something new to try.This is also a really great place to see local and regional music in an intimate setting. Unlike many room-with-speakers clubs like Red and Black or DC9, the sound here is great, and the overall experience is designed around the paying customer; band nights are Saturday and Sunday, $5 cover, 2 bands only, each band plays about 45 minutes; a perfect allocation of local music at the right price.The staff are very friendly and courteous and the service is great. The food, while basic, is decent and exactly what you'd exepct. The only really great place in Arlington to grab a beer and relax (except for possibly Iota)
cool little hangout in the burbs... nice veggie-options on the menu, to boot!nice job!
Definitely the coolest bar in Clarendon. When I walked in I was suprised I was actually in Clarendon; it's dark, there is cool art on the wall, they are playing AWESOME music and to top it all off they have 3 old school video games as tables in the back corner. The bartender was ultra nice and the food was surprisingly good. I really didn't know what to expect ordering ziti here, but it wasn't as bad as one might expect, quite yummy actually. I don't know if I would come here for a show though, it's really tiny and don't know how great the sound would be.
oh galaxy hut! amazingly friendly bartenders, awesome vibe, perfect patio, kereoke with decent songs and better than decent bar food fair.....perfection!??!?! alas, they do not serve liquor- just beer and a few wines. sortof a bummer for a vodka-tonic gal like myself...but listen, i overlook that flaw and down glasses of their merlot because the positives, in the end, outweigh this con.
Thank you, Galaxy Hut, for existing. Good, simple, cheap bar food; lots on tap; and way more interesting / way less crowded (when there isn't a show) than its neighbors.
I agree with Timoni that this place has that coffee house feel. Its much more of a hang out for the night place rather than a bar hopping place. That's probably a good thing because with their selection of beer on tap, its way too hard to pick just one!
Everone has already mentioned the great atmosphere, great beer, affordable prices, good music and Pac Man table. But nobody's mentioned the cosmic chili mac! It's so good! And during happy hour, I belive its only about 5 bucks. I also took my first-ever blind date here and it wasn't a total disaster, so I've got a special place in my heart for the little place.
Tiny little space and they don't serve cocktails! Only beer and wine. The patio is cool-- it's a closed off alley with tables and chairs. Very chill place if you want to get away from the yuppie Arlington crowd.
I'm glad to see the Hut is still around. I used to go here often like 9 years ago when I used to live in Arlington. I really can't believe it's been that long. It's like I remember it. Small, packed, only beer and wine, funky cartoony illustration art and decor. It always feels warm and cozy in here. Also still smokey inside which is why it loses a star (i'm a Californian now and I really appreciate our no smoking in bars, hospitals and daycare centers law).
Here's another cool place not yet overshadowed by the big boxes of Clarendon AND they're not a cheesy cover band bar. The Galaxy Hut recently took on a new owner (one of the bartenders, Lary, bought it from the original owner, Alice.) The Galaxy Hut was a labor of love for Alice. She really invested her heart and soul into creating a vibrant community for independent musicians and artists. There's live, original music on the weekends, karaoke on Thursdays, a full dinner menu seven nights a week and a new brunch on Saturday and Sundays from 11-3.It's a cozy little joint (oh, they also have cool video games like Pac Man and Galaga) and sometimes gets a little smokey. Take a look at some of the local artists displayed on the walls, too. The Galaxy Hut is a great place to enjoy true independent artists. Support 'em!
All right, I admit it. I have a crush on the Galaxy Hut. It's just so darn cute! It's cozy and fun and always makes me feel wanted and cool. It doesn't have a full liquor license (no spirits, just wine and beer) but that's just fine with me. I'll keep coming back. I can get vodka at home, but I can't get awesome cartoony wall art, the wackiest "patio" ever, and Ms. Pac Man anywhere else.
Cool, intimate club in Clarendon. This could be the smallest place I have been to as far as hearing music, but the vibe is very cool.I was quite impressed by the draft beer selection: they have over 10 on tap and over 30 bottled brands. Galaxy features karaoke nights on Thursdays, movie nights, cool bands (mostly local) and a great place to catch the 'Skins games. Last time I dropped in they were hosting a "BYOI" (Bring Your Own Ipod) night were audience members played 3 or so of their favorite songs from their IPods.
This bar offers much in the way of entertainment. Being open every night of the week with free movies shown on Mondays (how many things in this city are actually free?), a DJ on Wednesdays, Karaoke on Thursdays and live music on Fridays and Saturdays. They also sell brunch and bar food, but I'm not daring enough to try it. If I did, I would definitely try the veg burger (I appreciate when super small places still manage to serve a veg option). They have a site on myspace.com where you can check what bands will be playing and when as well as what flicks will be featured. I notice that some people come here to hang out on the side patio, which looks cute enough, I just haven't done it.
small, narrow outside side alley seating lit with christmas lights, quaint and intimate.
a comfortable bar for misfits and hipsters. order at the bar from a friendly bartender. great beer selection at decent prices. sizeable menu for late night snacks with a number of vegetarian options. an open patio out the side door. and a dash of spicy-hot music. blend ingredients to create a great summer spot for good people watching.
It's like a coffee shop, only with a good selection of beer instead. The decor is cool, there's no cover charge for the (daily) live bands, and the bartenders are very nice. Galaxy Hut is tiny, so if you want to see a band, come early, grab a booth and don't leave it.
