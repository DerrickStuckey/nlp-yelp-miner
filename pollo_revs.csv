Charboiled chicken is usually my all time favorite so I decided to try this place but it didnt hold up to the reviews in my standards. The chicken was dry and the skin was a bit hard, I can usually demolish a half chicken and I could barely even get through one half because it was so dry. Also the green and yellow sauces here arent great theyre usually more creamier and the green sauce should be spicier... If you want REALLY good chicken go to Guapos rotisserie (dont mistake with the restaurant) the chicken and sauces here are to die for
This place demonstrates why specialization is so economically effective. Chicken is their main and only entree, but what amazing chicken it is! You order a 1/4, 1/2, or whole chicken which is cooked over an open-flame right in front of you. The chickens are simply seasoned and deliciously tender. A great place for a fantastic chicken dinner at a reasonable price.
El Pollo Rico is right across the street from George Mason Arlington campus so it is really convenient for me. I always get the quarter dark meat with double fries. It is always delicious and never disappoints - consistent and reliable. Definitely recommend to anyone! Never had Peruvian chicken before eating here and they have set the bar high.
On point. Fast. Good. Delicious. It's best in class for Peruvian chicken. Plenty of seating and always fresh.
I;ve been going to this fine establishment since 2002. THEY LIVE UP TO THE HYPE. BELIEVE ME!!!! The yellow sauce is the shiznizzle and the chicken is cooked to perfection. First time I went there I turned my nose up because I didn't like the way it looked on the outside. I should have known better. We all know it's not about what's on the outside but what's on the inside and the inside there is heaven and greatness!!! I can't imagine how anyone could not like this place.
4 stars (instead of 5) because they don't serve beans! White rice but no beans?! Great tasting chicken!!
Chicken is perfectly seasoned and extremely juicy. I wish they served yuca because I'm not a fan of the fries.
Chicken here is so good! Very moist and juicy. I prefer broiled chicken over fried chicken, and El Pollo Rico's charcoal broiled chicken hits the spot. Paired with their green sauce, sides of steak fries and rice, and yellow sauce for the fries, I'm a happy camper. Unfortunately, they don't have yucca or plantains here but their chicken makes up for that. They're pretty cheap and two people can easily share a whole chicken and sides for $20. Parking is a bit tight. The lot is extremely small and fills up quickly. Whole chicken: $17.701/2 chicken: $12.40
AMAZING!!!!!! Sooooo delicious and flavorful. Reasonably priced. There always is a line but don't let that deter you as it goes fast. Great local find for sure!
The chicken and fries are absolutely amazing. It's one of the best Peruvian chicken restaurants in the area. I absolutely recommend this place! I would get cravings for this chicken while I was pregnant and would ask my husband to pick some up on his way home from work. The sauces are awesome and most of all, it's super affordable.
This place is plain and simple and has at least twenty tables but serves good spicy chicken. The sides which consist of steak fries and coleslaw are not very good but I came for the chicken which is better than Costco's but not by much. I can say that there is a steady stream of local people that is served with a mini assembly line. There is spanish music that is played in the background. The dessert that I bought was the 3 Leches which consisted of cake in a cup with 3 layers of milk products which tasted okay. Would I come again? Probably not.
This is my husband's favorite place to go. The chicken is very tastey. The staff are efficient and pleasant. My husband thinks is the best tasting chicken in the area, and we have had a lot of different ones to compare. We go here at least once a week when it gets too crazy at home to cook. The price is very good for a family of 4 dinner.
I got the 1/4 chicken with fries and rice. Huge portion of food for a great price. The chicken easily pulls right off and is absolutely fabulous. The sauces were too spicy for me, but I have very sensitive taste buds. I definitely recommend visiting this establishment! Great lunch spot within a block of Mason's Arlington campus.
From time to time the seasoning may be on the salty side.. but still my favorite chicken place in Arlington!
Still going here after 4 1/2 years since my last review. Still don't understand the appeal. The chicken always comes out lukewarm.
Pretty good... simple menu: Chicken, Fries, Rice or Coleslaw. This used to be by far the best Peruvian chicken place in the area, but there is alot of competition now. They still have the best chicken, but could use some upgrades on sides. The restaurant is no-frills, but I usually do take out anyway. They still need more parking, but they do take credit cards now (used to be cash only), so that's a positive.
Good stuff I went with friends and we all enjoyed ourselves. I will definitely go again and again.
The yellow sauce. Come to me now.Great flavouring on chicken. I also recommend the fries and slaw.
Peruvian rotisserie chicken.Quarter dark meat, cole slaw, and fries. I don't know what else to say other than this is pure deliciousness. I can eat this all day long.Chicken is always juicy and fall-off-the-bone tender. Slaw is alright and you can't go wrong with steak fries. Lines can get pretty backed up, especially if you go during lunch hours.Decent dining area, nothing fancy, but again, it can get pretty crowded.I dig Inca Kola.I dig the sauces - gotta mix both together to get the perfect blend.I LOVE the alfajores.Small parking lot.They take credit cards and there's an ATM inside too.
As a George Mason public policy student, this is basically our go-to place to eat because it is a couple of steps from our main building. And while I understand that is blasphemous to say anything bad about Pollo Rico, especially to the hordes of cultish fans in my school, but other than the delicious steak fries the chicken was sub-par. It was a bit dry at times and I had to drench it in sauce for it to have some flavor. As a student, I can't complain it is great. But as a critic I have to say that it isn't as great as everyone says it is.
THIS IS THE BEST PLACE IN THEE ENTIRE WORLD!When I hear "El Pollo Rico" my heart skips a beat. All I ever dream about is their mind blowing, juicy, savory charcoal broiled chicken with extra, extra WHITE SAUCE. That is literally all you need in life. My friend actually lives in the new apartments behind El Pollo Rico, and I am so jealous of her because I would be coming to El Pollo Rico for breakfast, lunch, and dinner EVERYDAY. No shame, it is THAT amazing. If you are hungry and can't decide what to eat - EL POLLO RICO IT. I promise you will not only love it, you will be addicted.CASH ONLY.
One hell of an unexpected gem. While in Arlington on business, I stumbled across this place thanks to Yelp - I couldn't be happier that I did. Absolutely wonderful service coupled with the opportunity to test out my dormant and dusty six years of Spanish and arguably the best half roasted chicken I've tasted made for a terrific experience. Cheap as well? What more could you ask for?
I'm torn about this place. Maybe because it's the first Peruvian chicken I've had in my life. It's kind of comparable when you fall in love for the first time. There's the passionate memories and emotions that come sweeping back every time you see that person - they just occupy a special place in your heart. But then you also realize, you've moved on. You've tried so many other amazing Peruvian chicken places that are just as good, if not better. They even have yucca, beans, and a hundred other options as a side! But why can't I move on? Why am I still listening to Drake in the shower and pretending it's just water streaming down my face?
I've lived in Arlington for 10 years and today was my first day trying this place. The thing is I knew it was in Virginia Square but never knew where since I've never seen it from the street. I also thought there wouldn't be parking and I would have to find a meter. So today I plugged in the address in mapquest and decided to go for lunch. It was indeed tucked away and hidden from the street but I was pleased to find a pretty big free parking lot so finding parking wasn't an issue. I also got there right around 12 which was slightly before the lunch rush. The chicken was delicious and moist and the fries were amazing. Crispy but not too crispy. The cole slaw was average. The only slight complaint is that the size of the sides were kind of small but I just read in someone's review to order to go even if you are sitting in because the plate is bigger to fill up. I look forward to continuing going to this place and now that I know where it is I can go to it if I want a quick meal to go.
The chicken was really good. But not much else in the menu department. The white rice is just bland white rice. How could a Peruvian chicken place not have fried yucca? I probably order a chicken to go, and then make my own sides at home. The chicken was good but not spectacular.
How I heard of this place: The first I heard of El Pollo Rico was at the end of April, when, after a Baha'i Holy Day celebration, the friends gathered at Quincy Park wanted to walk over to the local Peruvian chicken shop for lunch. Sadly for me, at the time, I was just beginning my two week raw food diet and had to pass. For six months I have not only been hearing rave reviews of the joint, but have been wanting to try it!Type of cuisine: Seasoned, charcoal broiled chicken, served in whole, half or quarter and sides: rice, fries, cole slaw. Simple.Ambiance: Having heard of the place so often, I guess I had drawn the picture in my head of a small, hole-in-the-wall, the air thick with the smells of thousands of roasted chickens. Instead, we were greeted into a large, open space with doors only for windows, brightly painted red, yellow and green along the far right wall, and sparse decorations. The only things on the walls were muted gold framed paintings of flamenco dancers, horses and Southern American landscapes.Recently having begun to take cash, two registers (one for cash only, the other for both cash and credit cards) sitting on a long countertop extending from one end of the restaurant to the other, separates the space between cafe seating andkitchen. A small menu of choices hangs above the 25-chicken roasters (I noticed two of them), with your chicken choices: whole, half, half-white or quarter. Each entree comes with two sides of your choice: rice, cole slaw, or fries. And each order is accompanied by either two or four sauces (a spicy green one, and/or a mayonnaise-like pale yellow one).What I ordered: On this, my first visit, I went with the half-white order of broiled chicken ($9.68) with cole slaw and fries on the side. My husband wanted an orange Fanta ($1), so we got that on the side. Two of my dining companions selected the half-chicken with double fries and our third eating companion selected the half-chicken with fries and cole slaw.On a return visit, Sunday, 29 April 2012: A group of twenty (or so) of us made our way to El Pollo Rico for the second annual 9th Day of Ridvan lunch in Arlington. Beginning at Quincy Park for a child-friendly Holy Day celebration, the children snacked on cheese-flavored crackers, Fig Newtons and juice boxes, to keep them comfortable while the adults allowed their appetites to build. Then, we all made our way over. Chris and I shared the Half White order ($9.68) with a double side of fries. Two bottles of orange Fanta ($1.70 each) later, we were full, happy, and licking our fingers clean!What I loved: The chicken is moist, tender and full of flavor. The thick-cut fries are perfectly crisp on the outside and soft and doughy on the inside. I especially loved the green, spicy sauce and was thrilled that I had two of them on my plate!Why I loved it: Simple menu. Quick food. Finger-lickin' tasty, seasoned chicken. Satisfying.Cost: Low to average ($7-$10 per chicken order, with two sides)
Yum! I miss working in the VA Square area and visiting EPR. El Pollo Rico, as you can probably guess by the name, is known for their Peruvian chicken. Wonderfully seasoned and juicy, they do it right. My standard order is a quarter dark meat, rice, and cole slaw. Their coleslaw is really creamy (sometimes a bit TOO creamy), the rice is prepared well, and the chicken is always served steaming hot and juicy. Carb-heavy, the meal (even if you just get the quarter) is filling. Lines can get long, as others have said, but it moves fast. You'll be pressed to find a table during prime time.Bonus - they serve Carvel!
The line in this place always resembles the line to Purgatory, but for good reason. The chicken is really good; juicy and succulent, tender and moist. That charbroiled flavor goes all the way to the bone. I know some people who try to eat here every day. I wouldn't go that far, but if I'm in the area, I'd probably stop on by.The options for sides are few: papas (fries), rice or salad. I always get the fries. A decent portion of steak fries and a "quarter dark" meal and you've got yourself a good lunch.Parking here SUCKS around lunchtime, so if you're coming between 12 and 1 pm, you might want to bring someone to go in and get the food while you wait or circle the block.
Oh gosh I love this place even thought I have to go back home to cook more my chicken because I love them to be very crispy. This place is like the expert in doing charbroiled chicken.. I recommend it and def come back whenever I feel in the mood for chicken.
Great Peruvian chicken.Definitely hits the spot. Lines can get long, but service is pretty fast.Go for the:- chicken (obviously)- fries
Went here for lunch with a co-worker who claims it is the best Peruvian chicken place around. The crowds for lunch and dinner seem to support this fact. They are really fast, even when the line is long. Nice, fast, cheap. My chicken was very good. They only have steak fries and coleslaw sides which okay.
Overpriced and overrated. Paid about $13 for an average 1/2 chicken with weak sides and they are a little stingy on the sauces. The food is not even close to Sardis, they only offer a couple sides, and the fries should be replaced with yuca. The price should be lower for a half chicken. Their profit isn't being reinvested into improving the business as it looks like it hasn't been improved in decades and looks dirty and cheap.
Love their chicken!! Especially their coleslaw:) Fries are soo very yummy and luv their prices. I grew up in Arlington so its my #1 spot for delicious chicken. So finger licking good:) You must try it out!
This might be my favorite lunch spot in the world. Their chicken and sauces are so addicting my wife and I drive from Richmond to Arlington just to scratch the itch. If you're looking for options and a vast menu, you're out of luck. You basically have one meat option (the best Peruvian chicken you've ever had) three side options (fries, cole slaw, or rice) sauces and can drinks. And oh by the way, it's served in a styrofoam tray. But guess what, no matter what time you get here there is a line. And for good reason. The chicken is so moist, tender and perfectly seasoned you'll wonder what everyone else has been doing wrong all these years. And the white and green sauces are like crack. You'll have to order extras.Listen, I've tried them all. And some other Peruvian chicken spots aren't that bad. But when you get here you realize everything else is just an imitation.TIP: order it to go even if you plan to stay. They give larger portion sizes to go because the tray is bigger than their plate.Enjoy!!
You haven't been here yet? Do yourself a favor, stop reading reviews and head here pronto.EPR, as known to loyal fans, does one thing and does it right. They have pollo a la brasa down to a science. The chicken always comes out succulent, crispy and perfectly seasoned.The steak fries and cole slaw aren't extraordinary, but serve as nice compliments to the meal. If I'm feeling a little wild, I'll also grab an Inca Cola. My only complaint is that they don't have yuca fries. That won't stop me from rushing over there for a delicious, affordable meal.
Certainly, their name says it all, Pollo Rico (delicious chicken) I have never been disapointed at this place, I know the line is huge, but I usually call my order in and walked straight up to the cashier to pick it up.*Clean place*Hot food*Cold drinks*Good serviceAlways go back to this place.
Compared to other 'Pollo' chains I've been to (The location in Baltimore is close to home for me and is AWESOME!), this location disappointed me. Although the chicken was good (a 7 on a scale of 1-10). their options were very limited. No fried rice, no plantains, no beans... wth?!? For the price, id rather tried the other 'Pollo' spots in the area.
This place is heaven on earth! My absolute favorite spot, hands down. I get the quarter white meat with rice and slaw, with 2 green sauces and 1 yellow. I'm not a huge fan of slaw and I normally never order it but its amazing here, must try! Sometimes when i have extra green sauce left over I mix it in my rice and its soo good! Everything about this place is awesome, the food, the service, the staff, and did i mention the food?!The only con is the parking can be painful during lunch hours, so either beat the rush or go afterwards. Bon Appetit!!!!
The chicken is juicy, and the skin is crispy. There are many Peruvian places in the area, but I think this is the best chicken. And the price is great. Get the sauces, and I like to mix them. Fries are alright, and I wasn't much on the mayonnaise based cole slaw. Best place for Peruvian chicken, but I do wish they had better sides to go with it. Was visited by Anthony Bourdain.
Lives up to the hype. This is the best Peruvian chicken I have had, hands down! The place was packed, with barely any available seats in a very large seating area. I went at 2PM on a Sunday. I did not have to wait at all to get the food however. Was ready 60 seconds after ordering. If you can walk or Metro I would recommend it...the parking lot had a line of people waiting to park both when I arrived and when I left. The cleanliness of the eating area is not the best, actually a little dirty, but that is not the reason to come here. The food is outstanding and cheap too!
Pollo mas rico del rea i Love el pollo everyone wants to compete bur Notting lije el pollo rico! I Love this place
Can't believe I've been here since 2006 and haven't written a review about it yet...Won't lie this is my fave pollo a la brasa spot and I compare other joints to it. yes it's had its ups and downs in the press, but it's just consistently good flavor-wise. I want to find a chicken place that's better (and that serves yucca fries. The steak fries are good but a bit bland and yucca fries are so much tastier.) I sometimes get annoyed that everyone goes here just cuz Tony B. said it was awesome, but I really can't begrudge anyone that.The tender chicken falls off the bones with seasoned skin that makes you wanna slap yo' mama. The green sauce is sooo good--just the right amount of spicy and flavor--I just want more of it!!! The steak fries are well cooked, just usually need a lil more salt. Which is weird b/c I'm not a big salt fan--in culinary school I was constantly being told to add more salt to my dishes--but here, they need more salt, at least in my experience. I'm very particular about my coleslaw so I pass here but they let you get a double fry, so that's awesome.Also, since I'm in full-time Spanish, they let me practice my spanish with the so, that's cool too! Living in DC I always forget about it, but I went there last week and realized I had been LIVING A LIE these last few years...life is better with a lil pollo rico in it...
It's amazing, just go.
Best chicken that I've eaten.
Chicken is good at an incredible price, but be prepared for limited sides and no parking. As my fiance and I are getting closer to our wedding date, we're looking for simple, easy, diet-friendly, cheap places to eat. El Pollo Rico hit all of these requirements. We got a dinner of two chicken breasts with 4 dips and 2 sides of coleslaw for $11. (Note: This is the half chicken white) The chicken was delicious. It was cooked perfectly, super juicy and tender, and along with the white sauce, was incredibly good. Take-out was quick and efficient and there's tons of seating.Now, that being said, there were some negatives that prevent this from being 5 stars. 1) The parking situation is a disaster. There were ~5 cars just waiting in the street to try & get in to the parking lot for a parking space. As others have said, park somewhere else and walk. If you're doing take-out, park in the lot across the street with someone in the car while you grab the take-out.2) The sides are limited. One of my favorite things about getting peruvian chicken is getting fried yucca. They don't offer this, and two of the other sides we couldn't eat. I'd happily pay a dollar or two more for fried yucca. Overall though, the chicken is great! and it was a wonderful, quick take-out meal.
I've heard about how great this chicken in for the longest time, but haven't experienced it first hand until recently. The chicken is so moist and seasoned perfectly. Super cheap as well.
Love the chicken!! As long as you don't mind smelling like the chicken by the time you leave this place is great. I miss the tamales, but we still keep coming back for the chicken.
Grabbed a quick lunch here on the way to Arlington National Cemetery. The breakfast options in the area were packed! El pollo Rico was a good choice for us as it was lightning fast and very inexpensive. Chicken is your only option here and it comes out very moist with a nice flavor. We opted for the mild sauce and I think we would have fared better with the spicier version. Mike sauce was very good, but lacked any kind of kick. We sometimes forget, being more accustomed to SoCal Mexican cuisine, that many varieties of Latin American food are not spicy. Their sauce here seemed to be mayo-based and it was tasty. The side options include fries (delicious, highly recommend), cole slaw (didn't get) or rice (which is white rice fyi). Great value.
exelente and yummy !11
There's plenty of pollo a l a brasa in the district, but this one really stands out. I know, I know, just because Anthony Bourdain went here doesn't make it the best place, but out of the other places I've been, this place seems to do it up right, and for several reasons. The chicken is always moist, and the skin delicious. While the skin may not be super crispy, it is super tasty. My only reservation is that these chickens are cooked in a gas-fired rotisserie. Some other places do it over charcoal, which imparts a smokier flavor. All told, the chicken is still top notch, and best of all because this place is so busy, there's so much customer turnover that you're guaranteed to have fresh and moist chicken. Some places if the chicken sits too long, the meat will dry out. While the sides are rather lackluster, it's par for the course among pollo a la brasa places. Nobody's really going to have good fries. The rice is always going to be plain white. And the cole slaw will probably be forgettable. The real star of the show here though, is the crazy hot green sauce, as well as the strange mayonnaise. The mayo pairs well with the fries, but I personally like to mix it with the green chile sauce and use that for the chicken. The service is also forgettable, it's very cafeteria-like, however considering the cafeteria-like prices in the rather more expensive part of Northern Virginia, I'll gladly give up good service in exchange for good value. Just be prepared to look for parking.
Fabuloso. This place is perfect for the indecisive such as myself - no overwhelming menu..you're just getting awesome chicken and most likely deliciously fat fries. And for the hot sauce lovers - that green sauce is FIRE. I don't need to add much more - you just need to try this pollo!
This place is addicting. Its no frills roasted chicken with possibly the best fries ever, and delicious dipping sauces. I get mine for take out, with an equally awesome Inka cola.
The quarter dark is moist and flavorful - with a nice crispy skin. The fries are thick cut and fresh, the coleslaw is creamy and a tad too much sauce. They even have Mexican Coke and Inca Kola! A must have for anyone that loves the chicken
Why the hell do I have to leave a major American city (DC) for the suburbs in order to get good ethnic food? Yes, DC has great 4 and 5 star restaurants but that doesn't make it a good food city! And to all you shits that think DC is a good food city, it's only because you're part of a fraction of the population that can afford to eat at those places! And you probably don't have good taste in food anyway because you're likely from some boring, white, upper-class American suburb.Anyways, on El Pollo Rico. This place has legit, Peruvian, char-broiled chicken. The chicken is cooked just right - juicy and tender. Most of the customers are Latino immigrants. You'll see few to zero caucasians in this fine establishment most likely because the front of the shop is very ethnic looking (this is how you know an ethnic restaurant is legit!). The charcoal ovens are pretty cool to look at too. I get the 1/2 chicken meal and that's plenty of food for me under $10.
Chicken here is gooood! Be sure to eat it with the yellow and green sauce. I hoped it would be 24 hours because it's such a 2am kind of place, but it's proximity to me is good enough. And we went around 8pm, but there was surprisingly a very short line. The only reason I didn't give it five stars was that it was more expensive than I thought. At least the half chicken with two sides was definitely filling!
My boyfriend and I saw el pollo Rico on the Anthony bourdain DC episode so we sought this place out and it did not disappoint! We split a whole chicken- absolutely the best chicken I've ever had! It was something in the spices- the skin was the best part. It came with two sauces- a chimichurri sauce and a mustard sauce- I preferred the mustard which was good as a fry dip too. The food was inexpensive, the line moved quickly, and the entire time a steady stream of people came in- lots of families. The Meal came with two sides-we chose fries and slaw, and both were good, particularly the steak fries. I highly recommend eating here if you're near the DC area.
The chicken is absolutely delicious - perfectly juicy and tasty and seasoned and cooked perfectly to my liking. The line is fast, and I believe I can attribute that to their limited menu and limited choice of 3 sides to choose from. I got the half chicken with rice and coleslaw and it was everything I imagined and more. My other go-to place with the boyfriend had been Super Pollo, but we wanted to try this place based on their reviews and yes, the chicken is THAT good! I do like it better compared to Super Pollo, but my one gripe is that they don't offer more sides like spinach, chickpeas, or yucca which are my usual choices at other Peruvian chicken places. They definitely gave us half the chicken. The portion was huge compared to other places I've been to like Super Pollo. The chicken at El Pollo Rico must be on roids or something because a half chicken was like the size of a whole chicken in comparison to other places. No complaints here! The coleslaw wasn't anything fantastic, but paired well and next time... I'm going all the way and trying the steak fries.To summarize everything: I would come back! The chicken is delicious. I just wish they had a few more sides, but if limiting people to 2-3 choices makes the line go faster - then c'est la vie! NO big deal. At least some yucca would push me to give this place 5 stars ;) There's tons of seating also -- even if busy on a weekday/weekend night -- but you never feel like it's too crowded which is awesome. Get ready to eat with your hands and enjoy a super tasty and very affordable meal. Nobody will judge you, I promise. Oh, and did I forget to mention that you can choose between dark and white meat? Mmmhm.
Chicken was D-lish-us! The line to wait for the chicken was unorganized and hectic but the chicken is great. I got the rice as I don't care for cole slaw. It's just regular rice. It it goes well with the chicken. I just wish I had some veggies to go with my meal. The mile sauce was surprisingly tasty, I mixed it with the hot to add some kick...will be back.
I used to come here 15 years ago when I lived in DC. Haven't been back since, and was afraid it would not live up to my fond memories. I need not have worried. The chicken is amazing!!! Moist, tender, and juicy. The skin is nicely seasoned. And the combo of the hot and mild sauce is perfect! I love this place!!!
Holy. Shit. Best Peruvian chicken I've ever had in my life. Perfection. The spices and seasoning on the chicken is fresh tasting. Even the green sauce is super fresh. Must be the high turn over in this place because there is always a huge line here. Chicken never gets a chance to sit to dry out in a warming bin. Or maybe there's a huge line here because the chicken is so freaking amazing in the first place. One of life's questions for sure.Why the four stars? Because you literally get only a few sides here and there is NO YUCCA. WTF El Pollo Rico. It's okay though, because they could serve this chicken with a side of packing peanuts and it would still be the best Peruvian chicken in Northern Virginia.
My god it's amazing!!!! I really love the chicken. I ordered the half. U can ask for two legs if u prefer dark meat. The fries are soooo good! Besides, can anybody tell me which metro station it's near by 'cause I don't have a car:(
My go-to for Peruvian chicken.
Best Peruvian chicken in the area, they don't have overlooked beef or dry yucca like other places which is great as I don't like those things anyway. Very busy so the food is always fresh. Sides are fries & coleslaw or rice. They take credit card too.
There are many Peruvian chicken places but none hold a candle to El Pollo Rico. The chicken is flavorful and moist without being greasy. Their sides are standards but that is not why you go there. Its cheap, easy, friendly, and excellent Perfuvian chicken.
Goodass chicken, fries and rice, get extra aji(the best part). I lived in Peru and have eaten more pollo a la brasa than i can count but I think this might be better than all of them. If they delivered, I'd eat it every other day
The chicken is well cooked and the sauces they give make it all the better
The 1/2 chicken white meat is the way to go. The only reason this place doesn't get 5 stars is because it doesn't offer beans and rice. What kind of South American spot doesn't have the most stable South American dish with it? Make sure you get one green and one yellow sauce and mix them together because it amplifies the taste of the chicken. If you go during the lunch rush, be prepared to wait for parking and wait in line for your food. Price is reasonable considering how much chicken you get.
My business is located across the street from El Pollo Rico. So being across the street from El Pollo Rico can be torture. The smell of the roasting chickens can be intoxicating. It is very hard to not eat there every day. If you want a big menu or variety, you will be very disappointed. If you want get roasted and seasoned chicken with minimal side, you are in for a treat. I am not a big fan of their cole slaw so I usually get rice instead. Traffic on Kenmore can be terrible so my advise is to walk there if you can.
This was my first visit and it was worth the wait standing in line. I had the half chicken with steak fries and slaw. The rub on the chicken was spicy and tasty. It seem to have a hint of coriander. Highly recommend and will go back the next time in DC .
Don't come here if you don't love chicken. The first time I came here, I saw that they listed things such as a "Quarter Chicken, Half Chicken, Whole Chicken." I ordered the whole, because I'm a growing boy. I should've realized this wasn't going to be a great idea when they asked "Are you sure?" Turns out ordering a whole order is essentially ordering an entire chicken family bathed in a delicious yellow sauce. And yes, of course I finished it. But it was a journey I never wish to repeat.
This place is great - a simple menu done right. It had been a long time since I lived in Arlington and ate here but it was just as I remembered it - quick, delicious, and packed.
Oh my god. So much yes for this place. It's delicious chicken. With fries and coleslaw. And Inca Cola. It's amazing. It's a favorite place for the boyfriend and I, for obvious reasons. Just plan on getting your hands a little messy and be prepared to wait in line. So worth it.
My Peruvian friend approves of this place. Closest thing from home she said.
Great chicken but no other food options ( Other than sides of fries, coleslaw, and more fries).
Not expensive and great!
After reading all the great reviews, I gave this place a shot. Honestly, I was not impressed. We order the 1/2 chicken with the fries and slaw and 1/4 chicken with fries and rice (we actually wanted beans but apparently they do not have those..). The chicken was decent -- maybe a little too peppery for my taste but otherwise very moist and tender. The slaw was watery and did not taste very fresh -- I felt like it was a scoop from the bottom of a tub/bin -- pretty gross. Fries were fries. Loved the side sauces!
You don't even know. This place is crazy good. It looks like a laundromat and the line often rivals that of the DMV, but it moves fast and it's totally worth it for that chicken. Delicious.
Walked into this unassuming restaurant since it was near my place. I ordered the quarter chicken with fries and coleslaw, and after a few bites, I regretted the decision. A quarter wasn't nearly enough.The sides weren't anything to write home about, but the chicken was one of the most delicious grilled chicken I have ever had. Easily beats more well-known places like Nando's or El Pollo Loco. The only comparable chicken I've had was from a farmer's market, but that was expensive.The atmosphere is extremely casual and the tables are carelessly arranged, but you're not here for the ambiance. You're here for the damn good chicken.
***** 900th REVIEW ! *****(For El Pollo Rico, not me personally)It's been a good couple months since I've dined here, (I used to walk 5-6 blocks from my old workplace during my lunch break), but I just HAD to write a review for them. As if they need another 5-star review. El Pollo Rico is THE spot. It's absolutely the BEST Peruvian Chicken joint I've been to. I've tried other pollo places all over VA, and even in CA. Nothing comes close so far.The menu, sure, isn't flashy, but simpler options in my opinion means they spend less time cooking up many side dishes, and more time focusing on what's really important- THE POLLO! The chicken here is perfectly cooked, seasoned with just the right amount of spices, and is just all around A+. The sides, like I mentioned are limited. You can choose 2 out of 3 sides for the meal: rice, fries, and/or cole slaw. Gotta admit, I looove the steak fries here! So yummy and crisp.The rice is my other option, plain white rice, but I get it so that the chicken is still the highlight of the meal.Treat yo'self to some excellent pollo! Go 'Rico!
Very good chicken but the lack of sides makes this not a weekly spot for me. How can a chicken joint like this not have beans, salad or yucca. If they did I would b here atleast 2 times a week but you just can't eat healthy when u go here. They make you eat creamy mayo coleslaw and French fries ..
Good eats for the low. The yard bird is always just right. It's tender, juicy & seasoned perfectly. Steak fries could be fried harder, but they're still good. Cole slaw is alright. I prefer mine more sweet.
Awesome! Awesome! Awesome! The secret to doing something really good is doing that thing a lot. That's what they do here. They serve chicken and chicken. Three sides to chose from: rice, fries, and coleslaw. And the chicken......wow! Juicy as can be! And the skin is nice and crispy! You can get 1/4, 1/2, or whole chicken. Go. Eat chicken. Be happy. :)
Quick walk from Virginia Square metro, fast service, excellent chicken at a good price. The fries are good, the slaw is okay, but the real reason to go is the juisy, well seasoned rotisserie chicken. Been here twice and will be going back.
You definitely get your bang for your buck here at El Pollo Rico. While affordable and tasty, El Pollo Rico does not compare to other Peruvian chicken establishments I have been to such as El Pollo Inca. The place looks a bit old and run-down. If you are in Ballston and want a quick cheap meal, this is the place to go.
Deeeeeeeelicious. I buy their chicken and rice all the time, and the place is always packed. You'll be happy with your purchase!
There are a lot of Peruvian chicken places in Northern Virginia. This one doesn't quite stand out from the pack.Don't get me wrong, the chicken here is good. They use charcoal in their rotisseries, which gives the chicken (and the whole street block by the way) a nice smokey flavor. Possibly because of the charcoal, however, the chicken is often burnt in a few areas. The chicken I got here most recently was a little dry, but with good flavor.The sides were nothing impressive. I got rice and plantains. The plantains weren't the smashed and fried (Banan Peze) starchy kind and they weren't the cooked and sweet ripe kind. They were somewhere in between - a kind of slightly sweet starchy place that isn't the best for plantains. The rice was fine.I've also gotten the fries in the past, which, judging by the preparation and taste, are just frozen pre-cut fries that they then heat up and fry in the store. Nothing special.Overall, I'd say this place is good, not great.
Before moving to Northern Virginia I had never tasted Peruvian chicken. This restaurant has absolutely blown me away. The chicken is moist, tender, and seasoned perfectly. The fries are alright, but I prefer their sweet coleslaw and white rice as sides. I don't do spicy so the green sauce is out for me, but the yellow dipping sauce goes great with everything- I think it's a mayonnaise base. They also have real Coke there (the kind with sugar, not high fructose corn syrup) so that's nice too. Everyone who works there moves fast and is friendly, so don't let the long lines stop you from enjoying the best Peruvian chicken in the area. There's also a large seating area so you should be able to find a place to eat inside even if there's no parking out front.
They love this chicken, and I love this chicken.I had my doubts trekking out onto the mean suburban streets of Arlington-on-the Orange-Line, but my skepticism was quickly allayed by the smell of rotisserie chicken. The best rotisserie chicken I've had - juicy and hot, and it falls right off the bone. Comes with creamy coleslaw and steak fries. If you come around lunch/dinner there will be a large line, but he service is quick and you'll have your chicken in no time. They also have this humming-bird sweet Peruvian soda that's worth a try.
Probably the best tasting Peruvian style chicken I've ever had. I was disappointed there wasn't any yucca, but the price was great, and the chicken was spectacular.
This place is amazing! The chicken is juicy and seasoned to perfection. The price is awesome! Yes, there's not many items to choose from on the menu, but they are the best at what they do!
The food is delicious! The dining environment is very simple but the price and quality of the food is worth it. It's an easy and quick place to stop and grab a quick and fresh meal for under $10. The servings are nice portions too.
For what this place is supposed to be, it is a well deserving 5-Stars. **Also, one of the few places I have ever rated 5-Stars**Scope: I usually eat here once a week, sometimes more.Hands-down the best chicken I have ever tasted. The yellow and green sauces with the fries and coleslaw have grown on me and I crave them as well. I have taken friends and family here, and they have all loved it. Absolute best.
Ate here last week. Yeah, it's just chicken, but I have to say, the flavor was amazing! The guy at the counter was friendly and the service was quick. I had the half-chicken plate with the steak fries and one of those awesome cane-sugar Coke's from Mexico. Good stuff...would highly recommend if you're looking for some good quality food at a decent price.
I love it when a place has roughly 4 things on the menu, and 3 are side dishes. Basically all they do is make one amazing chicken after another. When you walk in, the smell hits you and then you see all the chickens rotating on the spits in the back.The food is cheap, and the service is fast. Even when there's a line to the door, you get through it in just a few minutes. There's a good amount of seating too, so you can probably find a table. While it's fair to say that the fries, rice, and slaw are not all that special - who cares - you barely notice they're on the plate while you're devouring the chicken.It's a bear bones operation that will always have business because they're the best at what they do.
Cheap. Reliable. Delicious. You can't go wrong. Ever.
Fast quick and service. Delicious chicken! $8 for half a chicken and two sides is decent deal. The chicken was juicy and flavorful. Surprisingly, the line was really quick during lunch time. This place will be a regular lunch spot for me.
ProsRotisserie Chicken is tender, juicy, spiced perfectly!Steak Fries are delicious!Yellow sauce is amazing!Price is great! Whole chicken and two sides $15ConsLanguage barrier with staffFew options... Only rotisserie chicken and some sidesTables and chairs were dirtyPlastic utensilsNo serviceAll of this being said... the taste of this meal alone was worth 5 stars! I am incredibly impressed with how Delicious the food was! The positives far outweigh the negatives! Must try!!!
BEST PERUVIAN CHICKEN in Virginia, and I'm Peruvian. Great value, it can't get better than this. Simple menu but the chicken speaks for it self. Buensimo!
A must-try in Arlington. Always moist and tasty chicken. Great sides (get the coleslaw) and they have Inca cola :) The only downside is parking is usually terrible and there's almost always a line. Take your food to go - this place is not exactly known for its ambiance.
Literally THE best Peruvian style chicken. Sides are great, too (rice, coleslaw, steak fries, etc). Sardi's in Beltsville, MD was my favorite but this place completely outscored that place. Green sauce (jalapeo) and yellow sauce (close to honey mustard) make it even better. Very recommended!
Often replicated; never duplicated. Arlington landmark. 1/4 chicken, fries, and cole slaw for six bucks? And their yellow sauce is the bomb dot com.
This place has one major pro and one major con: It is the best rotisserie chicken I've ever had, but it's also just that: Rotisserie chicken. I think the range of flavor for rotisserie chicken is usually pretty consistent-- it's really difficult to make it awful but also tough to make it extraordinarily because it is after all just chicken. Thus, I think this place is worth a shot: probably get the quarter or the half if you are solo: the sauces aren't much to brag about so it can get somewhat repetitive. Nonetheless it's a nice spot to try in Arlington and the service is very fast. Only issue I have is the high price. $23 for a full chicken.
This place is awesome. You need to come here. The chicken is beyond description - more than juicy, more than succulent, more than tender. The spices bring out the deepest flavors. The sided are excellent. Grab a Coke hencho en Mxico and enjoy!
I grew up in South Arlington and for the life of me I can not understand why everyone who lives north of Four Mile Run Creek praises this place for their Peruvian Chicken.But Ive eaten here a total of 4 times over the last 4 years. I am not convinced.It is edible - but it is not better than Edys Chicken in Baileys XRoad.I ordered the half chicken (white meat) with yuca and an inca cola. That is what I order every time I am eating Peruvian chicken. There is nothing wrong with the service. The one star is just for a really bland Peruvian Chicken.
I love the chicken. The chicken is five star for me, but I take a star away for the paucity of sides. I don't mind cole slaw and fries - they are both good here - the fat steak fries and creamy sweet cole slaw, but I can't be eatin fries all the time. Maybe some beans and rice, or some vegetable sides. Nothing fancy.This place is a eat chicken warehouse. very basic atmosphere - get in line, buy chicken, find a seat and pig out. Or chicken out. The seating area is a big equalizer. Men in suits and ties have to slog it out with the rest of us, all sweating over some serious greasy finger pickin' chicken.You know it's real when you see the top four racial representatives of chicken chewers all in attendance in one rudimentary room: I'm talkin Asians and Latinos and Africans and Caucasians; families, singles, upper class, lower class, middle class, no class. Dude in Expensive suit and Cadillac SUV, family in Toyota Corolla, dude wobbling in on grimy bicycle, some delicious BBWs rolling up in a Lexus. WE ALL CAME FOR CHICKEN/ WE ALL CAME FOR FINGER LICKIN.Yeah baby.
Overpriced roasted chicken. Salty and small portion. Outdated and sticky table and chair.
My family owns this restaurant. This is awkward.
Delicious, fast, and cheap.
For grilled chicken, this place does it right. Fast, ample seating, and tasty.A good alternative to KFC and other chicken fastfood joints. You just order, the illegal workers who don't speak English chop your chicken, and you pay and go. I'm Lovin it!
Chicken super succulent and falls off the bone. Wish the place had better sides. Crisp and Juicy remains my favorite peruvian chicken place!
I don't even have to review this place, you already know about it. you've heard a million people talk about it. its absolutely the BEST chicken in the world, especially the best pollo a la brasa.    I always get extra white sauce, taste great with the steak fries!  And everybody who works here is very polite.great people great food!
it's as good as everyone says it is. (although less famous, i actually like the Wheaton location even better since they have better sides and are more free flowing with their yellow sauce)
Amazing chicken with great seasoning. Good fries. Slaw is a bit sweet.
EPR is simply the most delicious. Driving up towards the restaurant, the roasting smell is utterly enticing. A line? WHO CARES? The chicken you will eat is juicy, well-seasoned, and melts in your mouth. The ambiance isn't romantic, the service-ware is plastic and paper, and it does not matter. The family that runs the place has been there forever, and the staff is polite and efficient.  For a quick meal, you cannot beat it. You will NOT regret going.
The half chicken with white rice is my absolute fav. Tasty perfection! The sauce is what sells it for me tho! Haven't found one as good at any other Peruvian chicken place.
I love EPR's chicken, fries, green sauce...simple and perfect. I actually don't go very often, because if I did, I would weigh 100 pounds more.Even though the portions aren't unreasonably large, that chicken will creep up on your belly.
cheap, flavorful, and served quick by friendly staff. This is by far the best Peruvian chicken I have had in the DC area, and it's a bargain at under $20 for a whole chicken, fries and coleslaw. The seating is like a cafeteria--nothing fancy, but plenty of space to sit with friends and eat. Takeout is also a breeze if you'd rather take it home.This is one of my favorite restaurants on the Roslyn-Ballston corridor.
I am kicking myself for bookmarking El Pollo Rico over a year ago but not trying it until now. I finally made it out on a Saturday. It was raining, and there was track work on the metro, but it was all worth it.As some other reviewers mentioned, you aren't going to El Pollo Rico for the ambiance. There's a ordering counter and a good number of tables and chairs with varying levels of cleanliness. I lucked out and there was no line when I got there. When I left it was nearly out the door, though it appeared to be moving relatively quickly.I ordered the quarter chicken with fries and rice. This chicken is amazing. I have no idea what the seasonings are, but they taste delicious and the flavor is throughout all of the meat, not just on the skin. There isn't a whole lot you can do with fries and rice, but both sides were well cooked and went well with the chicken. My plate also came with a green chili sauce (which packed a little bit of a kick) and a white mayo sauce. I'm not really sure what they were for because the chicken was already perfect, but I guess you have more options to add flavors to your chicken.The portion sizes were plenty big (especially for the price!) and I was stuffed after my quarter chicken plate. But the chicken was so good that I actually did think about going back for some more...at least until I saw how long the line had gotten. Oh well...I shall return.
Northern VA's Peruvian chicken chains great, and this one has never disappointed. It isn't my top favorite, but they're usually busy, and everything is fresh. It's cheap, and the portion sizes are large!
No frills, but best chicken around. The line is usually out the door from about 5:30pm - 9pm any given day but it moves quickly and the chicken is worth the wait! This is my go-to late night/I don't feel like cooking meal. Get the half chicken even if you're not very hungry - it makes a great chicken sandwich the next day too. I don't know what the yellow sauce is, but apparently it's dairy free (yay!) and it's amazing.
This is a very affordable dive. People come and stay for the chicken.If you can overlook the Domino-like ambiance, everyone has to overlook the ambiance A little more space to sit down would be nice.What this place lacks in fancy ambiance is made up for in the taste.Overall this as a good value for the money.
REALLY good Peruvian chicken, best around. Only issue is the carry out option doesn't really save any time because of the timeframe they give you for pickup. It'd be quicker to just walk in and stand in line.
Best chicken and yuca ever! Eat here and dont be disappointed- its always full! $15 for a whole chicken and 2 sides. Enough for a couple of meals!
Love this place for a quick lunch. The chicken is AMAZING-seriously the best chicken in Virginia. Even if the line is long you never have to wait long- awesome quick service. For your money, you can't get a better deal.
Best. Chicken. Ever! I'm talking finger licking good!
I've had my fair share of Peruvian chicken restaurants, and El Pollo Rico is awesome. It's simple. Chicken is awesome and is definitely Peruvian. Accept no substitute.
Chicken is very good, but two things- They don't serve plantains (which is a big no-no, imo), and the inside decor makes u feel like u are eating in a vacant commercial space. Super Pollo excels in both these areas, although its service is a tad sluggish.
Big portions of fresh chicken with rice and beans, and delicious steak fries ..... and very inexpensive! Always crowded and is a local favorite, but the line moves quickly!
I love peruvian chicken and really wanted to love this place. The chicken was the best i ever had. The sauce was not authentic or true to the its peruvian roots. Sadly, what peruvian joint doesnt have yucca?  Tsk tsk. All the zagat reviews and accolades from around the nation including anthony bourdains exposure had me expecting more.
love it
Oh so tasty and you can't beat the price. It makes me want to reevaluate all the other places that I've given five stars. THIS place is quality. The service is awesome and fast. It's a busy place so you may have a wait, but it is totally worth it.
I have been eating at this place since 1996 when it was right off of Wilson Boulevard it is still that damn good
Best. Chicken. Ever.
Simple place and concept. There isn't waiter service. You won't be eating with silverware, but the chicken is excellent. Moist and flavorful chicken at a very economical price. The sides aren't really something to brag about but being that this place is about the chicken, it hits the mark.
Come for the chicken. Stay for the chicken. Get a roti chicken for the drive home. You cannot go wrong.
I've been eating El Pollo Rico for over 19 years and I've only been disappointed once ( which was when I ordered the cole slaw for the first and last time ..... NEVER AGAIN ) . Other than that ONE disappointment , this place has always made my taste buds happy !The chicken is finger lickin' good ; The steak fries are the perfect side dish ; And the dipping sauces make you wish you had ordered a dozen extra sauces .I usually order my food to go so I can't really complain about the lack of cleanliness . If I were to ever eat there , I'd probably complain about the tables being dirty and how uncomfortable sitting on a wooden chair is . I'm sure I'd deal with it like so many people do . Why ? Because the food is worth being temporarily uncomfortable . Yup , it's that good folks !
All the reviews are true. Stop looking at reviews and just go. WTF
Okay, okay, I tried it. Yes, the chicken is good. But, hmmm... Something's missing. What is it... Oh, I know! Everything else!No frijoles? No salsa? No tortillas?Nope! And super definitely no atmosphere. Just chicken, decent fries, rice and really terrible cole slaw. Didn't try the rice. Probably never will, now that I think about it, but who knows. I'll update if I do. I think 2 stars is actually pretty high for a restaurant with exactly one strong menu item. Especially when you consider that flame broiled chicken just might be the easiest meat "dish" to get right!
this place has amazing chicken! very flavorful and moist and has that charcoal taste that most places don't! the service is very fast and they are very organized! the place gets pretty crowded, even on a Sunday late night! it was clean and good environment lots of seating available, bigger then most places! the sides I must admit are lacking, when I went they did not have yucca! -_- reason for only 3 stars! they only offer rice, coleslaw, fries, and yucca. the portions are pretty good too, there just perfect, good amount of chicken and rice or fries! this place is one of the best for taste and great for pick up or eat in, and fast service! so I definitely recommend
Most authentic Peruvian pollo a la brasa in the area. The steak ftries and their house sauce make the perfect combination. Very rereasonably priced. Long lines on weekends.
We get takeout here several times a month. Always delicious, quick, and inexpensive. It's a weekly staple!
I moved across the country but came back for a visit. I made sure El Pollo Rico was one of my stops. The new location is much larger. The chicken is still just as good as ever, but they no longer serve plantains. I am not usually a fan of plantains, but they used to do them perfectly. Now the sides they offer are fries, white rice, and cole slaw.
My first visit to El Pollo Rico was like totally culture shock. It shouldn't have been, though. I went to school in Miami. I know how this goes, right? Well, in spite of the culture shock, I wish I had ordered a whole chicken. That's right. This chicken is just that moist, succulent, juicy, and well seasoned. I wish I had this chicken in my mouth every day!Why only four stars? Well, I took 1/2 star off because they only have steak fries, rice, or cole slaw for sides. I usually get rice, and then more rice. Wooo hoo. Wish I had some beans mang. Oh and the amount of rice they give you is enough to feed a family of four; even if you only get a quarter dark. I took the other half star off because of the chaotic and untidy dining area. I had to get napkins and wet them and wipe down our tables and chairs. It looked like four babies had been eating at that table. Bits of food everywhere: tables, chairs, floor, surroding area. Dam. I guess this is where the culture shock came in. I never would have left a table looking like that. Anyway, the chicken is good. Both my manfriend and I prefer the El Pollo Rico chicken over Super Pollo. But the lack of sides drives us to Super Pollo every time. Get to El Pollo Rico and get some good good chicken. Just don't go there looking for sides.Original Visit January 2014
Get the 1/4 with 2 sides. Absolutely wonderful.
Some of the best chicken you can get in the country: and I have been all over because of my job. You can't beat rotisserie charcoal cooked flavor.I have simply not been able to find a place like this anywhere else. I absolutely love this place. I used to eat here for lunch regularly a few years back when I was interning in DC. I wish Seattle had a place like this. It's affordable and worth trying.
The chicken was good, very good, but no yucca fries?! That was disappointing and their green sauce isn't great either. I would give them four stars for the chicken, but dock them for the things mentioned above. Otherwise, good place for takeout. Stick to the chicken.
Best chicken in town.
Sadly, I no longer live in the area and cannot enjoy Pollo Rico on a regular basis. Two weeks ago, when i flew into DCA to visit family around 8pm, the first stop, before going ANYWHERE, was to go to El Pollo Rico to get my half chicken and french fries, along with both the spicy and mild sauces, and yes, my Inca Cola.This place sets the standard for peruvian style rotisserie chicken. Other places attempt to come close, but this is the top of the mountain of chicken. It's the only thing on the menu, the ovens were shipped in from Peru, and they aren't gas or electric ovens either. Charcoal baby...and I'm not talking about Kingsford or Match Light here!The secret ingredient in the chicken is cumin.....it's not overdone or underdone...it's just right. The sauces are a fantastic complement.When I used to work in Rosslyn, this was a weekly stop. It got to the point where I was ordering over a dozen orders of chicken for my co-workers, who I converted to El Pollo Rico fandom.LONG LIVE POLLO RICO! Next time I'm in NOVA...I'm so there!
It's delicious mainly due to the chicken and sauce. Sometimes the chicken can be dry. This was my biggest issue that they provide so little sauce for the entirety of your chicken portion. Overall price is decent but the food is delicious.
Not much to say about this place except it is the best peruvian style chicken you will get in Arlington or anywhere in the DC area. There are a lot of competitors but nobody comes close to Pollo Rico. I saw Anthony Bourdain here and there's even video of it on youtube.
I've been to a number of Peruvian Chicken places in Nova, this is the best! The chicken was flavorful and moist. Only downside was the lack of fried yuca on the menu.
Comfort food at it's best. The flavor is great and the chicken is roasted to perfection. Num num num.
After first moving to the area I was very disappointed in the food options around my new home, however finding el pollo rico totally changed everything for me. IM A BIG FAN
5 stars for the chicken. The coleslaw sucks, the fries suck, the rice is okay. The chicken is what you want and the yellow sauce mixed in with the green sauce. It's probably the best rotisserie chicken I've ever had. You could probably eat an entire chicken because it's that good and not realize until later...don't share because you'll just get pissed off at the person next to you for not eating their fair portion. The line is always long, but it depletes quickly because they have about 1 million chickens spinning away for our tummies. GO!!!
Been going there for many years, it is affordable, amazing taste, fresh and clean, we are taking most of our guest there to experiance this amazing resturant, Highly recomended !!!
Chicken is juicy and delicious every single time. I have no complaints about El Pollo Rico except that they only have three sides, but I do understand this probably allows them to cook great chicken. I love the fries and the white rice though, how do they get it so sticky? This is a great spot to grab a cheap and tasty lunch in Arlington.
This is a must do. The chicken is outstanding.
Excellent food! Juicy spicy chicken and crispy yucca fries.
WOW. Best chicken in the DC area. By far. Impressive considering the long list of chicken joints in the area. They have perfected the art of seasoning a rotisserie chicken. Load up on the yellow sauce and grab an Inca Cola...you won't regret it. Cheap. Great tasting. Simple.Parking can be a challenge and it tends to be quite busy during lunch hours, but well worth the wait - the line moves quickly.
Love this place! My family gets take out chicken here at least two times a week. The chicken is always tender, juicy and perfectly seasoned. We typically order 2 halves all white meat, which is enough to feed 3-4 people (3 if you are all hungry). Prices have recently been going up, but remain fairly reasonable.The only criticism I have of El Pollo Rico is that they don't have a good side order selection (especially compared to some of their competitors), and none of the sides are particularly healthy.Other than the one issue, I'm a HUGE FAN!
When it comes to chicken El Pollo Rico is my #1 choice. Go 10 minutes early if you can to account for parking, the lot fills up fast! The chicken is perfectly spiced which makes it soo very tasty. The steak fries here are pretty good and go well with the chicken. I always love to get the Bottle Sprite made with real sugar from Mexico since its not widely available in other stores. The only downside is that they will charge you extra if you want extra sauce.
Been here a couple times and it was really good. But it has been a while, so I will give it a 4 star until my next visit.
Meh. With all the hype, I was disappointed in the half-chicken I ordered here last time I went. Granted, it could have been just a fluke but my chicken was a bit dry. The meat was also over-seasoned to the point where it didn't permeate into the overall taste of the dish itself. Sides are limited, and if you want a drink it's coming in a can. Don't get me wrong, this place has a very cozy, authentic and local vibe to it that other places can't match. But let's be honest, this isn't the best chicken in town (at least not anymore). Do yourself a favor, and hit up Super Pollo down the street and see the difference for yourself. Otherwise, come here for the warm, neighborhood vibes you get from eating chicken off a paper plate, sipping on canned Aztec beer and having good conversations with your buddies.
I like this chicken, I have been going for years, the yellow and green sauce also are delicious! The cole slaw is a lil runny but the steak fries and chicken are a diamond in the rough!
Really popular. Not really bargain basement. Chicken's pretty good, not the bomb.
Will be the food I miss the most if I move away from the DMV. Simple, cheap, amazingly delicious. Quarter white - double fries. All day, every day.
Chicken is great! but sides are very limited, only potatoes, rice and coleslaw, which I don't like. Otherwise I would be a fan.
El Pollo Rico, its been too long since I've had your delicious chicken. So long, in fact, I forgot how you actually tasted, just the memory of great flavors. You were my first charcoal chicken, making you the best by default. The creamy white sauce, the fire from the green, and that unbelievable flavor from your charcoal infused chicken. Since the last time I have visited you, I've flown half way around the world, lived in Alaska, and fought in two separate wars. I've eaten so many other pollo ala brasas, but my thoughts always returned to you. But now upon my return, I realize I have found another... The memories we shared so long ago were with a less traveled and less mature palate-ed me. I will always remember you as my first pollo... But now, unfortunately, not my best.
With all the hype surrounding El Pollo Rico, I was so pumped to finally try it. As a general rule, I LOVE Peruvian chicken! The line was literally out the door when I came here and I waited for about 30 minutes, figuring it would be so worth it. I noticed that the workers were friendly and efficient despite how busy it was. When I finally opened that steaming to-go box of chicken, I was sadly disappointed. The chicken was soggy and mushy with a lackluster seasoning. There were more "guts/insides" than meat. I didn't like the sauces either, they add way too much mustard- yuck! The rice was good (hard to screw rice up) and so were the fries, but I didn't go to El Pollo Rico for the sides. I was surprised that they only offered two sides- where are the plantains and yucca?! I will stick to Super Pollo and Edy's for my Peruvian chicken where I can get a delicious meal for a fraction of the wait time.
About a 2-2.5: I was excited to try El Pollo Rico out as another Peruvian chicken option in the area. The chicken itself was okay, where the skin was well-seasoned, but did not permeate throughout the whole meat. The sauces that come with seemed a little bit watered down for me. The aji sauce seems more mustard-based rather than the salty tanginess that you usually expect. There seems to be a lot of locals and regulars who come here, and I'm glad I was able to try this place out!+tasty skin+watery sauces
I kept hearing this was the best Peruvian chicken ever, or just the chicken period. The Chicken Place in Bailey's is better. I don't like the spices here, the wait is longer due to over-hyping, and when I asked for Horchata, they gave me a can. A can! Maybe it'll be better than the stuff from the bubbler fountain, I thought. No. Terrible. Horchata from a can is terrible.
Some of the best chicken around, although sometimes it's better (crispier skin, more heavily seasoned) than others. Wish they had black beans or some sort of vegetable (coleslaw doesn't count!) since it's really not a complete meal to eat chicken, fries or rice (good rice), and coleslaw. Wonderful milhojas. Always packed but the line moves quickly
Absolutely delicious, generous portions, and reasonable prices. Could you ask for more? Also fast service and plenty of space to sit. Also they have those Mexican cokes with real sugar!!
I don't get the hype of this place. Maybe, it's because I can't discern the intricacies of Peruvian chicken, but their chicken tastes the same as the million other places serving it up in NoVA. To add, they only serve three sides, none of which are fried yuca. Half the reason that I go to Peruvian chicken joints is so I can satisfy my fried yuca fix. I'd rather walk a block and go to one of the million other joints where I can get my fried yuca with a side of chicken.
SO thankful that this amazing place a crosswalk away from work whenever I'm in Arlington. My coworkers and I always salivate (figuratively, to maintain professionalism) at the smell of the roasting chicken from across the street. I always order a quarter of the chicken with rice and coleslaw. Usually I'm not a fan of coleslaw, but even that is tasty here. While waiting in line, my coworkers and I remarked the dozens of chicken roasting in the huge open oven--it probably heats the entire place!? I dream about the seasoning and marinade to create these perfect chickens. Sometimes I am too scared to eat the sides for fear of losing the amazing taste of the chicken. It's always so juicy and tender... never a disappointment! And the servers work so quickly to prepare each order but are still are patient to my curiosity about the other food on the menu. I'll always be back!
Man... I WISH this place was located in Charleston, SC. Someone needs to open one down here bc it rocks. The Peruvian chicken was absolutely delicious and coupled with the usual fries in that lovely oil they use. The coleslaw at this joint was spot on... they used their mild (yellow) sauce as the base and it couldn't have been a better side to pair with the others. I went in expecting maybe a little wait. Oh no.. it is an assembly line of folks... one putting the chicken in, the next for your sides and sauces, the last cashing you out... all in all.. maybe 3min I stood in line before i was walking out the door. I hope it is still kickin' when I visit the area again. And again, for the folks that own it and read this... please open one in Charleston SC!
Definitely my favorite Peruvian chicken in the DC area. The food is delicious and well-priced. The staff is friendly and service is always prompt. A place I'll return to again and again.
What is there left to be said about the place that launched a thousand rotisseries. They have been roasting chickens longer than I can remember out of a repurposed warehouse and have consistently produced the most succulent chicken that has ever graced these lips.They must be using unicorn tears and powdered liberty in the marinade because this is as good as it gets.The Richest Chicken Indeed.
BEST. CHICKEN. EVER.Sometimes I dream about the tenderness of the meat, the flavor of the skin, the creaminess of the white mystery sauce, the spicy kick of the equally mysterious green salsa. The BF and I argue about the best way to eat this amazing Peruvian chicken, but most of the time by the end of the meal, both of us succumb to ravaging it with our mouths. And we are both so, so satisfied after. If you are ever near DC, please, please make the trip out here. It's definitely worth it!!!PRO TIP: Skip the Inca Kola. It's basically cream soda.
This is the best chicken. Everything is as simple as it should be: menu, restaurant space, side items. I finally found this place a month ago and have been going once a week. At nearly $10 for half a chicken it's a little more expensive than your average pollo brasa, but the highest quality should come with a higher price tag.Going to start trying their desserts shortly here.
Doesn't look like much from the out side. A simple menu that they do f-ing excellent.
My family and I love this place.My mother was the one who turned me onto this place. The portions are large and yummy. The menu is pretty basic chicken fries and more chicken. We've been coming here before Anthony Bourdain visited. Even then during lunchtime the line would be out the door and you couldn't find any parking.Every time I drive by the area you can smell the yummy savory chicken a couple blocks away!We usually get our food to go. We often have leftovers that last us into the night.We've been here before and it actually run out of chickens!The desserts are also good. Sweet satisfying and worth the price.The only drawback is they don't serve yucca. If you've never been here before it's definitely worth the visit. Be sure to buy extra sauce because that stuff is addicting.
This place would get 5 stars for the food itself as I have picked up from there before. The reason they are getting 3 stars is because I ordered for delivery. It took an hour and 40 minutes to get my order tonight. I would of spent $20 if I had gone and picked it up but instead spent $60 with the $35 minimum, tax, fees and tip. This place only makes one thing and the chicken is coming out non-stop, there is no reason for the order to take this long. Frustrated and disappointed. If they would have at least called to say it was running late I would of given them 4 stars.
Hot damn, thank you Yelpers & Anthony Bourdain! This Peruvian chicken joint was phenomenal. I don't know what is in the mystical rub they put on their chicken but it makes my tongue and tummy happy. While Super Pollo has their wide variety of delicious sidekicks (fried yucca, beans, plantains), you come to EPR for the consistently amazing chicken. On my 10+ trips to EPR, I've never had a dry or overcooked piece of chicken. It is IMMACULATE, my friends. Also, what do they put in their green chili sauce that makes it like edible crack?! I need the recipe for it so I can promptly spread it on all of my proteins forever and ever. The restaurant itself has lots of sunlight, but doesn't really have much of an atmosphere. You don't really come here for the atmosphere though. You come here for ZEH CHICKEN.
Fast, inexpensive and flavorful! Real busy from nearby workers on lunchbreak, but personnels keep the line moving fast! Order at the counter then get your own table kind of a place! Two thumbs up for the food! Atmosphere- very casual!
This place is awesome- there is no better place in Northern VA to get peruvian chicken. There is another place less than 1/4 mile away and I can not believe they are even still in business with this place. I always get the rice and coleslaw as my side- but the fries are awesome too--- I just try to stay away from it since I will eat all of them! The parking lot is crazy- I have been there right before it closes and there is still lines; but totally worth it. Usually I drop my boyfriend off and he runs in and I just keep lapping the parking lot since it's easier.... no thrills inside; I don't think I have ever eaten inside- I always take it to go.Do wish they gave more sauce....stuff is awesome and LOVE it. Only suggestion- bring cash- they do take credit card but the cash line goes a lot faster and you can get to eating your food quicker :)
The best. Period. No other Peruvian chicken joint comes close. Nuff said.
Excellent chicken, ,do you feel like chicken tonight, well if so come get some!Its awesome here, great texture, not too dry. Sauce is good, they charge for extra tho. I usually got rice and coleslaw, its how I roll!
My husband and I had big fancy plans yesterday but when the spot we were going to was closed, we "settled" for this place... And we are so glad we did!Tremendo dive that made this Miami girl's taste buds happy!Don't expect anything fancy. Cafeteria style, simple food... But DELICIOUS and cheaper than anything else you'll find in the area.Loved it!
Great!
EPR - THE best.Kicks Super Pollo's pale lame copy of Peruvian chicken.
Yummy chicken and just like any other Peruvian Chicken place.
In one word (or three):ay ay ayyyyy!!!
Arlington County Landmark! Must try!
I'm the millionth person to say it, but WOW!!!!! Chicken is outrageously amazing. It's also fairly priced! Just go!!
So I am basing this review off my experience at Sardis. Compared to Sardis the chicken is dry and does not have as much flavor as i would hope. I found myself enjoying the fries more than my chicken which is usually never the case. Typically i devour my chicken from Sardis before touching my sides. Also the portion of food at Sardis and variety of sides is much better.
OMG! How could I have been so blind all these years? After our first visit, we sort of wrote this place off in favor of Super Pollo because of their killer fried rice. I guess I hadn't realized at that point how much better and stronger the spice rub was. Then by chance, we went over to a friend's place who had brought EPR take out for dinner. Our mouths rejoiced in culinary happiness!!! Stopped by again and the place did not disappoint. I think I can say this is our favorite place to get Pollo a la Brasa!!! I'll still need to go somewhere else for sides though.A whole-hearted "as good as it gets!!!"
nothing crazy. i like the parking lot and ample seating. chicken has been dry the two times i've been there. also, sides are only fries and cole slaw. when i went there with my gf,  i noticed one portion was significantly bigger than other. not crazy about this place.
Quick chicken with two starches. My kids love the chicken; I think it's just okay. It tastes a little like cumin. Also, I would like salad or vegetable sides. (Fries are not a vegetable.) Parking lot can be a zoo. The atmosphere is fast food. But it is indeed fast (usually), and pretty convenient.
This is the most delicious Peruvian chicken I've ever had! My family and I have been coming to this restaurant for years and it's the best. The fries are amazing, and the sauce is the bomb. I can always count on this place for some great food.
This place is the real deal. The best quality peruvian chicken in DC, Authentic vibe and croud, and at the best price point. If Im spending my money on Peruvian chicken its here.
Yessss!!! Perfect place for pick up some chicken, it's delicious!We stopped in for a quick snack before heading home. Luckily it was pretty empty and we got out orders very fast.We loved the atmosphere with my wife and the food and service were also great. Plan to return back!
The chicken here is fabulous. Really great. The sides and sauces leave something to be desired. Overall, very solid and a real Arlington institution.
OH MY GOODNESS. (Second) Best chicken place ever!!!! The only downside to this place was the lack of parking in the vicinity (it's in the Virginia Square/GMU area, so parking is scarce). We did manage to eventually find parking in the tiny lot by this restaurant. My bf and I visited on a Saturday and both ordered the half chicken with white rice and steak fries on the side. I REALLY enjoyed my meal! It was filling and the chicken was DELICIOUS! Some of the best chicken I'd ever tasted and though this place is Peruvian, it reminded me of the chicken I'd have at El Pollo Loco, a Mexican food chain in southern California. I'd dare say that after El Pollo Loco, El Pollo Rico has the BEST chicken I've ever tasted! So succulent and juicy... I will crave it all the time. Thankfully, it's located conveniently in Virginia Square so I can visit again soon!Oh, and the Inca Cola was a bit strange (both my bf and I tried it) - it tasted like bubble gum! I doubt I'd get that again, but everything else was absolutely amazing.
Best pollo a ls brasa in the area - by far! Simple menu, great food.Not the kind of place you bring a hot date, but if you're looking for the best chicken of your life, look no further.
Their chicken is great and flavored well, but docking an extra star because they don't have yucca fries, which is a very important part of the Peruvian chicken experience for me! And their sauce is fairly pricier than other places, though part of it may also be that Arlington is more expensive too.
Best chicken I have ever had. Even the white meat is very juicy and flavorful. I usually order fries and rice with my chicken since they both have an amazing flavor. The cole slaw is too creamy in my opinion so I stopped getting it.
Peruvian Chicken at it's finest! Come here for your real peruvian chicken experience, trust me food coma in progress. I've had plenty of Peruvian chicken in the Arlington/DC area and this place has hands down the top. Like Anthony Bourdain said "Crack Chicken". I mean always juicy, always succulent, always tender, always flavorful. What's better than some cheap, top quality, fresh food?? Inca Kola for the win with your amazingly delicious chicken with some las papas fritas and some crack green and yellow sauces!!! Do I need to keep going or should you just try it yourself!?!?!
The constant line at this restaurant shows what type of local favorite it is. I am a repeat customer and come once every few months. It's good chicken in a no-frills restaurant. I wouldn't bring a date here but if you're in the area and in the mood for chicken then this is the spot. I'm a little disappointed with their sides but the chicken is really good.
That Peruvian rotisserie chicken is amazing. Get it once or twice a week. Really hits the spot. Half dark with fries and rice. The chicken is moist and tender, and since they roast it in front of you, if you go during meal hours, the chicken is almost guaranteed to be burnyourfingers hot & fresh.Highly recommend.Only downside, they have slaw, rice or fries as sides. Need some beans.
Oh my gawd. Best chicken. Theeee best. I drive up from 20 minutes away to get it and I have similar Peruvian chicken places near me. The only down fall is there's no yucca. But it's simple - you come for the chicken and it's awesome. Fastest "fast" food ever.
I really like the chicken here and the fries and rice. I wish they would make the place have a better atmosphere to eat though. I would like to eat in here more often. Mostly you find loud characters dining in here so it's not a pleasant place to sit down and eat.
Not sure why there's so much hype about this place. Guess this place has always had better press, even after the drug bust of the former owners. I found the chicken here a bit too salty. You can get better Peruvian-style pollo @ Super Pollo in Ballston or Crisp N Juicy (Lee Hwy).
Totally addicted! I work near this place. My HR person turned me onto this place. I've been here once a week since. The chicken is juicy, the skin has the right spice. The green hot sauce can be hit or miss but that is forgivable. Parking can be a pain and finding a place to sit too but the food is awesome.
If heaven is a place on earth, I think I've found it. Ever since trying El Pollo Rico, I have yet to return to Crisp and Juicy, which was our former Peruvian chicken place.The chicken and fries here are just fantastic, and I love the creamy mild sauce. Two meals for the two of us for about $13 - and we couldn't be happier. I love this place. Don't ever change.
I finally got around to going to this place after reading all the glowing reviews. I don't really understand why the DC area has so many restaurants that specialize in chicken, since I've never lived anywhere that had that same phenomenon. But since I live here now, I figured I'd go to some of them and see what the big deal was. Maybe there are lots of Peruvians living here. The chicken at EPR was fine but I didn't think it was anything special. They use some kind of dry rub on it but the skin wasn't crispy and I don't like eating flabby chicken skin, so I didn't eat the skin. The meat didn't have much (if any) flavor from the rub. The steak fries and cole slaw were very average - nothing special about them. It's pretty obvious they don't use fresh potatoes, since places who do that have dramatically different fries. The menu is very limited - no yucca fries available, no beans of any kind. They have the same mild mayo sauce and spicier green sauce as every other chicken place I've been to so far. So I don't know who all these people are giving this place such a huge reputation. They must live very close by or be comparing it to a fast food chain or a college cafeteria or something. The next time I want chicken, I'll go someplace closer to home since these places seem very similar. I have yet to find one that stands out in any way.
Best chicken I have had in the last 10 years!!!! Perfect blend of spices and side dishes. The sauces are amazing and the fries are crisp! Must go if you are in the area!
The roomie and I were strolling around Arlington when we both noticed it was about 6pm and hunger had set in. We both had never tried El Pollo Rico btu had heard a lot of hype about this place.I would say their chicken at best is average. Standard roasted chicken and some over fried yuca. The meal wasn't really memorable. I really wouldn't go out of my way to go back here, nor would I want too. There are plenty of other Peruvivan chicken places that have better tasting chicken.
I must follow everyone's high praise with my review. I had spotted the overwhelming popularity of El Pollo Rico on Yelp before, but I didn't get a chance to try it until I had a class at the George Mason Arlington campus right across the street. I now go once a week for a very satisfying pre-class dinner.The simplicity is part of the charm here. You can pretty much only order chicken with either fries, rice, and/or cole slaw. But damn, is the chicken good! I usually the quarter chicken w/ rice & cole slaw, which ends up being more than enough. I LOVE the sauces they offer - the jalapeo green sauce and the yellow sauce. I usually just ask for two yellow sauces since it's so delicious. I'm always tempted to ask what's in it, but a part of me likes not knowing (I imagine a mix of honey mustard & mayo).If you find yourself in the Ballston area of Arlington, I highly recommend you check out El Pollo Rico. This is why I love Yelp - this place is such a hole in the wall that I would have never found it without this great app. What would I ever do before class without El Pollo Rico? Study?!
The best Peruvian chicken joint in the US. I could eat this chicken everyday, it's that good. Tastes awesome with the yellow sauce, crunchy fries, rice and cole slaw for only $6. LOVE it.
Very good food, but parking is kind of a pain and sides are somewhat limited. There's a place called PioPio down the street that I think is just as good and has better parking and more sides.However, both places serve excellent chicken.
I'm going to get lambasted for this, but I'm taking away a star due to lack of choices of sides and their coleslaw is uninspiring. But honestly, that's the only thing I can gripe about here.Their Peruvian chicken is some of the best in the area, the Yuca fries are insane, and they have pretty solid desserts!
I've never had peruvian food before but if the chicken here is peruvian style I like it! Our party of three adult and a kid polished off one and half chickens. I think there's a cumin spice in it that made it so tasty. The sides are just okay.
The tastiest, juiciest, and most flavorful chicken you will have in your life. The add ons are fries, rice, and cole slaw that are very delicious. Can't go wrong eating this ever, absolutely delish!
It's allllll about the chicken! I have yet to taste anything even remotely close to their amazing spiced flavor, even without the sauces. The rice and fries take a gracious backseat to the flavor explosion that is the chicken, so if the sides are what you care about, then El Pollo Rico is not for you.As a born and bred NOVA local, take my word for it; when people come back to town, THIS is the first place they want to go.
I think it's just ok. Don't get me wrong, they make pretty good chicken, but just good, not great. They put a lot of green seasoning on the skin so thats the difference I noticed from other peruvian chicken places.I love my sides but they don't even have yucca fries or even beans! That kind of ruin it for me. They also ration the amount of sauces you get. The price is quite steep for cafeteria style.
Chicken is great, service is great. I'm disappointed in the lack of side dishes. All they have is fries, rice and coleslaw. I'd give them 5 if they had any vegetables or yucca.
Delicious! We stopped in since it was near our hotel while we were in town for a friends wedding. Saw Anthony Bourdains pic in their listing and he couldn't be wrong right? The menu is simple, desserts are good. Next time I'm gonna order the whole chicken. Love the green sauce they give you with your chicken.
Super Pollo trumps this place all day...Though El Pollo Rico has good chicken and it is better than most places in the area it is still not as good as Super Pollo. Often this place has long lines during lunch, for just chicken and fries, I don't get it. Don't understand why this place has no real Peruvian side dishes?The steak fries are terrible. Obviously they are pre-cut frozen fries, which are never good. The only other option is the regular rice, which is plain and has no flavor at all. Super Pollo has over 10 different, unique, sides to choose from.Finally the price... Super Pollo again has El Pollo Rico beat. The 1/2 chicken combo will save you a few bucks.
The chicken is delicious. You can cook chicken many ways but El Pollo Rico cooks it great. From the sauces (white and green) to the juicy chicken, you can't miss. I recommend this place.
This is the only place I can eat chicken because it's so delicious I tried many other Peruvian restaurants and there is no comparison. This place is always full you can't even find a parking space that's because it's so delicious. Every time I stop in here I told the cashiers I came here from far away I always drive like 40 minutes to satisfied my appetite.
The chicken here is on point! Tender, juicy, flavorful!My bf and I shared the half chicken, it comes with two sides and two sauces. We opted for fries (for me) and the cole slaw (for him). As for the sauces, we got the green sauce which was spicy and the other one which had a sweet mayonaise consistency. I dipped the chicken in both to offset the spiciness for me.Fries were fries, typical and nothing extra-ordinary. As for the cole slaw, it's a bit different from your traditional cole slaw. It looked creamier but didn't taste creamier. Kind of hard to describe, but it still wasn't bad. Next time we'll try the rice.I could see ourselves coming back here if we are in the mood for Peruvian chicken!
I used to work cross the street at FDIC and eat there 2 may 3 times a week. By then (2003 and 2004) it was cheap, hot, fresh, and tasted good. I noticed people from afar to come to enjoy the chicken. Through the years the price has increased (whole chicken from $11 to $17.70) but the taste remained the same. White and green sauce still the same and the fries are still the same. It's a bit far for me now but I would drop by whenever I have a chance. No service to speak of, you pay for your choice of chicken and drink with sides and you find a table to sit down and eat. Parking is limited especially during lunch hours. They don't offer yucca fries in case you are looking for them. No plantains either. You can get there on the Orange line metro by getting off at the VA squire stop and walk a block and a half and that will take care of the limited parking issue for you.
Good chicken, cheap prices. I have had better Peruvian chicken, but that's because I'm a food snob from SF :)
Love, love, love this chicken and the fries and slaw are good. Fast and inexpensive too.
Great tasting, affordable chicken!
I like it a lot, great to pickup to feed large groups. Get extra sauce!
What a Peruvian style! No kidding, there were about 200 people in restaurant. Parking? Yeh right. We parked 4 blocks away and walked. But, chicken smell that we can really smell it from 4 blocks away! Don't need GPS to find them. MY nose was GPS! Try it!!!
Some of the most flavorful chicken that I have ever tasted. Unfortunately, that doesn't make up for the poor sides. I thought that having fries would be perfectly fine, but alas, they don't salt them nor is there any ketchup (make sure to bring some of your own if you plan on going). Not to mention that I'm sure I've had better coleslaw from a can (if there were such a thing). I can't find myself returning just for the chicken.The seating area was also dirty and the whole restaurant was pretty grungy looking.
If you are in the area and haven't been, do yourself a favor and go here. Other places like Super Pollo have more sides, etc. but the chicken here is special. So good!There's a small lot out front and some metered parking right by. Inside, you'll find a cash only line, as well as a line that accepts credit. The prices are very reasonable and eventhough I have moved away from the immediate area, I always enjoy coming back.
El Pollo Rico is delicious. My friend had raved about it for quite some time so I figured I had to try it. It was worth it. The chicken was fresh, juicy, and extremely flavorful. The fries were crispy and fresh. The cole slaw was just OK, but the chicken and fries completely made up for it. I will definitely be coming back here!
Food was amazing, half size portion very filling, would definitely come back if in the area.
Que Rico! El Pollo Rico chicken is some of the juiciest and flavorful Peruvian style chicken you are gonna find. I guarantee it. So succulent was my chicken breast, I was licking my fingers. The chicken, paired so masterfully with fries and cole slaw and then top that off with that green hot sauce, washing it down with some Inca Cola and you are going to sleep real nice that night. I know I did! Good food makes me happy and sleepy. I love this place!P.S. there is now ample parking in the lot and they do take credit cards (only M/C and Visa)
After seeing all the great reviews, I headed into El Pollo Rico for the first time. Got a half chicken, fries and slaw. Overall, it was a small chicken and overcooked. The white meat was dry, and the skin was a soggy mess. The smoke flavor was ok, but nothing to write home about. In the Arlington area, I have to go with Crisp and Juicy just off Lee Highway. Better flavor, better sauces. The El Pollo Rico basic sauce was low on the flavor scale. The hotter green sauce was a bit better. The fries were pretty much cold, soggy and unappetizing. The slaw was ok, but I have not found many Latin Chicken places that pay much attention to the sides.
AWESOME!!! They are really nice and the food was great!!! Its a win win for me!!
Looks like the original owners may have sold the place. The quality of the chicken has gone way down. The skin is no longer crispy, white meat is super dry and flavorless. Will probably not be coming back here.
GREAT local Peruvian chicken restaurant. There are a few with similar names throughout NoVa but this one is right across from my law school and has a special place in my heart. Honestly they all taste the same in that they are always fresh and even if there is a long line, the employees are super efficient at plowing through the line!
Amazing
Do you want chicken? Do you want fries with that? This is the place I highly recommend. It is quite cheap and inexpensive. Greasy too. Satisfies cravings for fast food. Though often the line is long but the food is definitely worth it.
Ohhh mi madre! This place was the bomb dot com! Finger licking delicious. The chicken was moist, well-seasoned, and meaty. The fries were hot, crunchy, and cooked to perfection. The sauces, ohh my gawd, the spicy one and the garlic butter, ohhh my gawd. I loved it. The staff is super friendly and the greet you the moment you walk in the door and are just all-around welcoming. The food is quick, the price is incredibly reasonable, well-kept and clean. Loved it and will definitely be coming here again... and again... and again... and again. Like my mouthgasms... :)
salty chicken, lack of good sides and a general dirty atmosphere. Go to Super Pollo 2 blocks away and have a better experience
Best chicken in arlington! Just order chicken, yucca and fries. Affordable prices.  Taste is incredible. I love it. Great meal for your family. Hours are great. Get lunch and dinner to go. Get the green sauce. I know there is more on the menu. However, if the name is el pollo rico, you get the chicken. Am I right? Of course i am. See you there!
I have never had Peruvian food and I am not sure why there aren't more Peruvian restaurants in the US because their food is great. The chicken here is juicy to the max and their steak fries are pretty darn good, too.
Sure, as everyone says, it's the best peruvian chicken in the area.But that's akin to going into a school for the blind and finding the best student driver. Sure, someone may be able to keep it on the road some of the time but a crash is inevitable. The steak fries are awful.
Very good food! If you're looking for ambiance on a date, look elsewhere. If you want to impress your date with your knowledge of good Peruvian chicken...go here and then take her someplace afterwards.
There are tons of options for Peruvian chicken in the DC area, but EPR is the only place I'll go. It's seriously amazing. And as it's only about a 10 minute walk from my place, I'm there at least once a week. It's also the first place many of my out-of-town friends and family want to go when they come to visit. It's nothing fancy and parking can be limited during the busy times, but the chicken is totally worth it. Sides aren't anything to get excited about as they are limited, but I don't got for the sides, anyway. Seriously, check this place out. More than worth it. :)
We both ordered 1/2 white meat chicken with fries. I got the cole slaw, he got the rice. The chicken was perfect. Tender, moist, succulent, and seasoned into oblivion (in a good way). The fries were crispy and satisfying. The rice was well cooked and seasoned well. The cole slaw left a great deal to be desired, it was really kinda soupy. Not my favorite. Most of the time when you hear about a place like this you expect a tiny little place with a focus on take out and just street parking. This place is actually pretty big with plenty of parking in the front lot and lots of tables. We had no problem parking, getting our food, and sitting down at 7:00 on a Friday. The best roast chicken I've ever had. Can't wait to bring friends.
Love it. Love it. Love it.
Everyone has a preference on their peruvian chicken, some say super pollo, some say crisp and juicy, but I say Pollo Rico is my favorite by far. I've had all those places, none of them have juicier, tastier chicken than Pollo Rico. Love it.
I don't get the craze?! The chicken is good, but definitely not the best. The flavoring was great and it was moist, but the skin wasn't crispy. Also the fries were soggy, who likes soggy fries? I also don't like the fact that they do not have a variety of different entrees or sides; they didn't even have yuca or fried rice. I was disappointed.
Juicy chicken and crispy steak fries - there are two lines, the cash only line is always shorter so bring some cash. Also, get your order to go - not only will you get more food it will also be easier to eat with the various compartments.
Great chicken and they move the line fast. Good chicken, moist, and well seasoned, and reasonably priced.
The chicken here was good, not great. I went out of my way to go try this place with my family. The seasoning was okay, but the skin wasn't crispy. And the french fries weren't that great either. I enjoy steak fries, but these were not crispy on the outside, nor were they fluffy in the middle. The coleslaw was pretty plain and not exciting in anyway. The only thing is that the Inca cola was solid, But you can get Inca Cola in any Peruvian place pretty much.The server was really nice. They gave us a big pitcher of water for the family. And the place was pretty popular so there were lots of people there, but it wasn't hard to find table. When we got there about six in the afternoon, there was plenty of parking. But when we left about 45 minutes later the parking lot was full. The closest Metro stop was at least 10 minutes away. So if you're going to come to this place either come early and find parking or be prepared for a little bit of a walk.
Don't ever tell me there is a better place to get Peruvian chicken because I will prove you wrong in so many ways. I've been coming to El Pollo Rico for years, and i have yet to be disappointed.... no, like ever...This place makes my heart happy!!
This is, hands down, the best Peruvian rotisserie chicken around. I used to live in the area a few years back and loved eating here. After being gone and trying many other Peruvian chicken restaurants over the last 3 years, I was worried I had built this up too much in my mind...but after eating here again recently while visiting friends, it only reaffirmed just how amazing this place is.
Best Chicken and French Fries ever I tasted in Northern VA!For non-locals and tourists: highly recommend it!!!
I'm pretty sure they rub those chickens with crack, because it's the most delicious and most addictive bird one can have in the DC area. Steak fries are excellent too and make sure to wash it all down with some Mexican Coke, the liquid type!
Yelp never fails me. I am telling you man when I see a simple place like El Pollo Rico getting reviewed by 700+ people...you know there is going to be something special going on. Boy was I right.Holy crap is this chicken good. This might be the best chicken I've ever had. Chicken and fries...so simple...so damn good. So glad I got both sauces too. The green is so spicy and the yellow just tastes tremendous (actually better for dipping fries in). You have to pair it with the Inca Cola for the full experience.Let me tell you...if you judge a book by it's cover then you probably won't like it...and you are probably should be on yelp. This unassuming dining hall-like atmosphere adds to the allure of El Pollo Rico. The dining room is as simple as the food. To top it all off...get the sandwich cookies for dessert. They are worth the trip just for the cookies! The filling tastes like a Nutella and caramel mix. Tastes pretty good dude.When it comes down to it this will be a repeat dinner spot for my guaranteed.
I really don't get what the hype is.This place seems about 4-5x more popular than the Super Pollos in Arlington and I just don't know why.They both serve pretty much the same stuff, so my friend and I decided to try this place one day.Our chicken was...weird. The skin tasted great with all the seasoning, and the chicken was good too. The problem lied in how moist the actual chicken was. It was dry near the outer sides of the chicken and most right next to the bone. At Super Pollo it'd be moist throughout the entire chicken.The rice...LOL. Yeah, it's actually laughable. First off it was dry as hell and you're only given an ice cream scoop worth. The fries however were nice and crisp on the outside and soft on the inside; I definitely think their fries are better than both Super Pollos. At Super Pollo however, the rice is much more moist as if freshly made and you're also given a noticeably larger portion.Now what really irked my friend and I was the green sauce that they give you along with the yellow sauce for dipping. The green sauce I guess is made out of jalapeno and green peppers or something; I'm not sure. The problem was that at Super Pollo, the green sauce is spicy, has a kick, and is an actual sauce with a liquid texture containing the bits and pieces of the peppers. What we got was a nasty, dry, brittle "sauce" with little to no liquid. It was as if we were eating chopped up green peppers. It was gross.What you get here is cheaper than it would be at Super Pollo and the fries are definitely better...however the chicken, green sauce, rice, and portioning makes it inferior to the Super Pollos in my opinion. Normally I'd give it three stars but when you've had the same thing elsewhere that was much better overall, it's hard to do so.
This place is amazing. The chicken is the tastiest ever. There aren't many sides to choose from but the taste of the chicken makes up for it.
Delicious and cheap. This has been the standard for Peruvian chicken for me, which no restaurant has ever even approached.
one word : amazing
I've been eating here since El Pollo Rico opened in 1989 or so. Still remember the first bite, delicious unlike any chicken I'd had before. Consistently delicious today. Fast, affordable, fun. I dip my fries in the mild sauce and chicken in the hot sauce.
Best Peruvian chicken out there!!!!!!! I have eaten at both locations no difference in chicken.
I've never had better chicken.
So delicious. I can go here multiple times a week and not regret it.
This place is one of my FAVORITES. In grad school at GMU I went there every Wednesday before class. The chicken is just perfect. The sauce is amazing. It's so simple and yet so perfect. This is probably my favorite Peruvian chicken place outside of Peru.
Stayed at the Residence Inn Marriott down the block and needed a quick, inexpensive place to eat with the kids. Well, we found it! The bonus? The food was DELICIOUS!!!
Have nothing much to say about this place other than that this is one of the best Peruvian chicken place I have tried! Juicy, tender, well spiced. The sauces are good. I wish they had more side options like Super Pollo which is the only thing I like better in Super Pollo. But chicken is superior here. We mostly order for delivery at home.
El Pollo Rico is a classic place. Good Chicken and great fries. I wish they had more side choices but its okay. only downfalls for this place is parking, they make you pay for extra sauce, and not enough side choices. otherwise we come for the chicken and stay for the chicken!
This is basic Peruvian chicken at its finest! My chicken has always been juicy and flavorful and since I loooove french fries, the addition of steak fries is a winner in my book.The chicken can be ordered in 1/4, 1/2, or whole. Each order comes with two sides; choice of rice, cole slaw, and steak fries. In addition, you get two sauces; green and yellow. (I don't like sauces so I am not sure what they are).And while the line may reach out into the parking lot, don't let that stop you because it moves really fast.  If you choose to dine inside, there is plenty of seating. It appears that the dining area is not well attended, as the seats and tables are always sticky, but if you don't mind sticking to your seats then you will love this place.El Pollo Rico has its own private parking area, but during lunch looking for parking can be a nightmare. Again, remember, that since the line moves so fast, you won't have to wait long before someone moves their vehicle. Unless they got stuck to one of the seats on the inside...then your wait time might be slightly longer.
The best peruvian style rotisserie chicken in Arlington. For $6 you get a 1/4 chicken a healthy portion of delicious steak fries and cole slaw. I have been eating this since I was a child--my ultimate comfort food. Chicken doesn't get any better than this.
Some of the best peruvian chicken out there. The atmospheere is nothing to brag about, but get it to go. Make sure you get some green sauce too! You won't be disappointed! I promise!
So good!
This place is overrated. They introduced a lot of folks in this area to "Peruvian Chicken" so thanks for that, but they haven't evolved to keep up with newcomers. I live a block away and rarely come here because the sides are uninspiring and the chicken often times dry.Fortunately I work near my favorite chicken place, El Pollo Ranchero.
Best Peruvian chicken in the DC area IMO. Excellent rotisserie with magical spices. Fantastic green and white sauce and yucca/cole slaw. The service is very efficient and this place can get really busy. Definitely give it a shot!
Very very good place to go. Their chicken and fries re fresh made. The two side sauce re so tasted. I went there any times. They never disappointed me. Chicken meal + inca cola = ^~^
We literally followed our noses there back in 2005-ish. When we were first looking for it I said, "That can't be it, it looks like you should have your oil changed there or something..." but in fact it was the place for awesome chicken! We affectionately call it PR. There's no atmosphere to the place but man do they have my favorite 'go to' food around. I guess I could give them 4 stars because they don't have plantains, but I love their fat steak fries so much that I probably wouldn't get them anyway. Their yellow sauce is a staple for my crowd. We usually go over board and get a good 10-14 of those suckers. The green sauce is too spicy for me but also a hit. I like the rub they put on the chicken here and have been to a few other Peruvian chicken places where I didn't like the flavoring as much. It's cheap, easy, good for gorging yourself and they take credit cards (which they never used to do).
Delicious. The only negative to this place? That it's not within walking distance of the office.  Always order the 1/4 white with double rice and extra of that yellow sauce that is just delightful. 5+
So good. Stop reading reviews and just go.
Always the same thing and always reliably good.
This chicken is magical. I've never had anything like it before or since. The staff is great and they really put up with annoying white people like me who want to pronounce every Spanish word like its English. You must get up, leave work, get in your car, and drive to El Pollo Rico right now. NOW! Seriously. Do it. Now.....now.
between here and super chicken, I can only say they have the best chicken in the DMV. So far the best ive come across and I always try out different Pollo spots.
I got a quarter chicken with steak fries and slaw. I like this place because it's casual, cheap and convenient. Is it a Nando's? No but for the price, it's the best you'll get. Also has anyone noticed how the Inca Kola and champagne soda are exactly the same aside from color and container?
Very good, reasonably priced peruvian chicken. I actually think that Super Chicken in Tysons Corner consistently produces the best peruvian chicken in the DC area, but that's my opinion.
It's easier to walk to this location if your metro accessible but parking will be an issue. The chicken is delicious if that is all you care about however the side dishes are very limited. Fries, Rice, or Coleslaw.It's still worth coming out here once in awhile to enjoy the moist, tender, and well seasoned chicken.
I've eaten off-and-on at El Pollo Rico for a few years, and I used to have clients that LOVED to eat here. So, having started to Yelp since my last visit, and having a dining experience fresh in my mind..El Pollo Rico is perfectly serviceable- I wouldn't not eat here- but it's not exceptional in any way. There are MUCH better options locally (Super Chicken, Crisp & Juicy, Super Pollo), though none are as convenient to the Metro as El Pollo Rico.The chicken is flavorful, if a little dry at times. El Pollo Rico has service down to a science, and you can expect to have your chicken in hand moments after ordering, hot out of the oven.It's everywhere else that El Pollo Rico collapses in its own mediocrity.The sauces are okay- not great- and they're ridiculously stingy with the portions they serve. Orders (of any size) come with two small cups of sauce, either mild (spiced up mayo) or the spicier green chili sauce. That's not nearly enough for a half chicken, and if you want more, you'll have to pay extra.And you'll want more, because the fries here are f l a v o r l e s s. They're thick, and well-cooked, but they have no taste. They need to be paired with the sauces to give them some flavor. Do you want yuca? You won't find it here.The only two other sides on offer are cole slaw- which I haven't tried, because it's not something I'm a fan of- and rice. The rice is overcooked, salted white rice.So if you're in the area and don't have a car, you could certainly do worse than El Pollo Rico. But if you want a great meal and have some flexibility, check out some of the other, better options in the area.
This place is awesome. I'm a huge fan of peruvian chicken so I had to try it out. I usually get the standard quarter chicken, fries, green sauce, and inca cola. It's so cheap too.I would recommend going during an off-peak time since this place gets super busy during lunch and dinner hours. It's definitely a regular place for locals to grab a quick meal.--Check out my other reviews at nextstopdc.blogspot.com
Don't let the neighborhood or the sparse decorations dissuade you. This is the real deal. Mouth watering, well-seasoned, piping, fresh slow roasted Peruvian whole chickens with the requisite sides. If I was a chicken, this is how I would want to go -- well tended to, cooked with tender love, and bound to make a consumer re-assess their affinity for chicken and Peruvian food time and time again.
This place is great. You get a lot for your money, and the chicken is oh soooo tender and flavorful. Whenever anyone comes to visit the area, I always take them to this place.
You guys HAVE to try the chicken here! It is really "el pollo rico" ~ rich chicken! It it so flavorful and moist~!!! I wish there were more choices on the sides though, but I like the green, spicy sauce that comes with it. Just talking about this is making my mouth water! =D***From the outside, it doesn't look too big but once you walk in, you'll see a lot of tables. It's not too fancy though, so you can dress casual. Behind the counter area, you get to see poor little chickens getting roasted inside an oven =( I will definitely go back for more delicious chicken when I'm around Arlington, VA again! Enjoy guys!
This defiantly is a hidden jewel of the DC area. Very convenient in relation to the subway. Very, very small menu; what it does have, however, is absolutely fantastic! The chicken (the only entree item) is delicious and full of unique flavor. Comes with two sauces that I thought were absolutely fantastic and unique. They also serve Inca Kola, which is a soft drink that is incredibly difficult to find and definitely worth a try. Very economical place to eat as well, will be back!
I'm going to go against the grain here, but I can't buy into the hype. El Pollo Rico isn't a bad place by any stretch, but it seems to have an aura of being the best place for Peruvian chicken. Quite honestly, I don't think there's any place in DC that can do Peruvian chicken so well that it deserves 4.5 stars over close to 700 reviews - at best, this place is above average. Anyway, my guess is that this place gets a lot of attention because of the divey no-frills atmosphere, Anthony Bourdain's visit, and/or the compounding of hyped up reviews on Yelp. Kind of like a chain reaction.Food - simple menu. This is a good thing... they're doing what they know best. None of the other BS, but just charcoal broiled chicken. The chicken is solid. Steak fries, not so much. Atmosphere - completely laid back, cheap wooden tables, and a place where your food is served on Styrofoam. Honestly, it's a nice change from all the upscale restaurants in Clarendon. I like it.Parking - almost non-existent. Take the Clarendon metro and just walk the short distance. There's metered street parking nearby, but it'll be pretty hard to find a spot TR/F nights.Also, be prepared to wait in line for dinner... it wraps around (and sometimes even goes outside).Again, I like this place, just level set your expectations. Don't expect come here to have the best chicken in your life, but just know you're going to get some good food.
Based on all the reviews this place doesn't stack up to what I read on yelp. I have a feeling that after Anthony bourdain's visit they got a lot of popularity and business was really good. I don't see anything special in this restaurant that i haven't tasted in other peruvian chicken places. The only sides they have are french friens and rice. The staff is alright. Honestly, go to Super Chicken. They have all kinds of sides including platanos. How can a peruvian chicken place not serve some kind of plantains?? I started this review at 3 stars but changed it to two because it really doesn't deserve that even.
Best chicken I've had in my life. There can be a line, but it is worth it.
So. Damned. Good. That's all there is to say. The only flaw of this place is that they don't have more sides.
Really is not all that. Having eaten amazing pollo ala brassa in Miami. this does not compare at all. long line, limited choice for sides. sauces were blah. really no be deal at all. I found a better tasting chicken joint hands down. hit me up if you want to know where it is. or just check my reviews.
The first and still the best.
I don't get the hype. I really don't.I have tried to give this place another try, multiple times. I cannot get into it.First, the chicken is not that great. It is SMOTHERED in seasoning, you cannot taste the real flavor. And the breast is so dry here. I couldn't get it down without having to push it down with water. Eh.The sides are so limited. My partner's family constantly brings us here - although I despise it. I just cannot get into this place. It's too over seasoned and the chicken gets dry. I don't get that crispy skin that people have mentioned. Again, so many better Peruvian joints in the DC/VA/MD area.
Definitely one of the better Peruvian chicken restaurants in the area. The chicken is very good but the sides taste like they come from cans. The cole slaw is a turn off and doesn't really go with authentic pollo ala brasa. The deserts are very good.
Easily the best chicken I have ever had. Three menu selections: whole chicken, half chicken and quarter chicken. There are two lines one for cash and the other cash/credit. Lines can be long and tables scarce during lunch. Rarely will you get a parking spot in the lot, so grab the first one you see on the street. Always worth the trip.
hands down best peruvian chicken Ive had. Its always juicy, tender and great taste. The staff is always friendly and keep the lines moving. I always get 1/4 chicken white meat with fries coleslaw their yellow sauce and a can of inca cola- never dissapoints
Watching about 30 chickens being cooked as I waited in line was so cool!! They cut your chicken parts right in front of you as you order. Ordering should not take long at all it's which Parts of chicken you want and only 3 sides Fries,Cole Slaw and Rice! Yuck! Not a variety at all The rice was good & sticky kind of salty and The chicken was seasoned really well and juicy. All in all the meal was good but this is not my #1 Peruvian chicken place but it's doable!
really great chicken. Juicy,flavorful, and equally good the next day!
The chicken here is amazing, definitely the best of all the peruvian style chicken places that I've had the in the D.C. area. Sure, the sides selection isn't great, but who cares when the chicken itself is this good. Next time, I'm just going to get a whole chicken by itself instead of a half chicken with sides. And it's cheap.
If Anthony Bourdane loves this place you know it's not bad. Great place super yummy!! The chicken is super flavorful and I love the yellow and green sauce!Peruvian chicken at it's best!!
Great for what it is: rotisserie chicken spot. Big, very casual, self serve dining room -- often gets packed at peak times since the food is reliably what its supposed to be every time. If you come and eat, you will regularly crave this chicken... worst thing about the place is that it is often packed to the gills -- when it is bring cash and get in the cash/express line
You come here for the chicken. The chicken meat is juicy and full of flavor, sometimes even a bit salty. I usually choose between rice, french fries or coleslaw as a side and usually pick two.As an avid rice consumer, I can eat their rice side in one bite! They only literally give one scoop of rice as a side and it is really small. However, if you ask for french fries as a side, it will cover half the plate.Four stars for the chicken which is the best in the Ballston / Arlington area. I prefer Edy's chicken the best but it is much further from my house.
This place is so good I'm 100\% certain I can eat a whole chicken. The thought of eating an entire animal, all by myself, is a little unsettling but once you get a taste of the chicken here you'll lose yourself in the moment and before you know it you'll look around and shout "WHAT HAVE I DONE?!?"I've had a long history with the chicken here; my dad has worked nearby in Arlington for more than 20 years now, and whenever we did well in school or he received good news at work he would pick some up and bring it back home to celebrate. It's no lie that the chicken helped fuel my childhood desire to do well in school and why my brother and I always said "Yes" to spending Saturdays with him in the office when he had to work overtime.When I first moved to Arlington I was here at least every couple weeks; there have been a lot of other Peruvian places that have opened up but they all can't touch the palace. I usually get a quarter white chicken and double fries, you can get coleslaw with it but it's not for me. I heard they have a few other options out there now like yucca and rice. Some friends have said the chicken goes great with the Inca cola as well. Parking can be really tough, it's actually common to see cars double parked on the lot but the food is worth driving around a couple times for a space.You can actually smell the chicken a block radius outdoors. People pay the high monthly rent in North Arlington not just for metro convenience but for El Pollo Rico.
Quite delicious! Tons of flavor! We ordered a whole chicken, with yuca and fries. Also ordered a chicken sandiwch. Both were awesome and super fresh right off of the rotisserie wheel. A bit pricey I will say that compared to other places available in the area.
This food is a slight guilt trip, but it's worth it. The fries, when dipped in the green sauce and mustard-mayo, taste spicy and interesting, although the fries themselves are a little boring and not the best. The coleslaw was sweet, crunchy, and refreshing. The chicken was soft and tender, and the meat came off the bone right away. You can taste the salty, peruvian spices in all of the chicken meat, and the skin, while fatty and greasy, was savory and crunchy and sooo good! Although there aren't many different sides, this restaurant has outdone themselves for their price range.
THE BEST!!!!It could definitely use some additional side selections besides just fries and coleslaw, but the chicken more than makes up for it. In short, GO THERE!
Best peruvian chicken I've ever had. The meat falls off the bones, and the skin is well seasoned. The fries were good, but I would have liked plaintains to have been an option. The chicken makes it worth it! I actually liked the green sauce on my chicken, too.
Cheap peruvian chicken. Pretty ghetto and def not a spot I will be visiting again. If you like cheap down scale eating spots this is your place. Only thing good here is that it is a reasonable price. Have fun if u go.
Do I need to go to Peru to compare what Peruvian chicken tastes like in Peru? As I am of Asian descent, I have no clue what Peruvian chicken should taste like. However, my taste buds did enjoy the chicken. The meat came off the bones easily, skin was full of flavor, sauces were saucy. And they have inka cola!Very casual setting, so if it gets packed, you might be sitting right behind another customer.
Fast service. Best chicken. Always fresh (because they get so much business). Very friendly. You just can't beat it.
This is a very simple review:*The chicken is excellent. *The fries are excellent*The sauces are excellent*The rice and coleslaw are... okThere are tons of charcoal chicken places in the area, but this is by far the best. Not as many side options as Super Pollo, but I think the main event (the chicken) is superior and the sauces are definitely a cut above. Miles above Pio-Pio in all ways. One warning: if you eat this chicken you WILL develop a craving for it a few days or a week later. Do not be frightened, just go get more.
The food is great, but the service is a little biased. The people in front of us got a mound of fries, but when we ordered our chicken with two sides, we clearly didn't get the same treatment. The chicken seems smaller than at super pollo.
Wish they had more sides, but the chicken rocks.
I've been a customer for almost 20 years.  A co-worker from Lima introduced me to the Ric's many enjoyable meals later. Of all the Peruvian stye restaurants, this one has something different. It's a family-run place and I've enjoyed watching the business grow over time.
Best chicken in town! The chicken is always moist and full of flavor. Staff is always upbeat and friendly. Everyone MUST try this place out!
It is a fast food restaurant at its worst, I hated it!
If this place is only going to have three sides, I would expect these sides to be very good to exceptional!None of them were.The rice was ordinary white rice, the fries were your average steak fries, and even though I didn't have the coleslaw, it looked like what you would find at KFC.But I give them a pass thinking they spend all their time and effort on the chicken so that will surely make up for it!I have the chicken, and maybe it was all the hype that built up in my mind from the phenomenal ratings on yelp, to the fact that this place was on TV and visited by Anthony Bourdain no less! A purveyor of good eats!But the chicken doesn't live up to all this hype! Don't get me wrong, its a good tasting chicken, and like many things with food it is very subjective. I would put it behind Super Pollo and even Guapo's taste-wise.Mix this with poor sides and increased prices and you'll see me at Super Pollo.
The bf drags me here on a regular basis and I'm not a fan of roast chicken. However, Stockholm Syndrome has kicked in so I'm giving this place a solid thumbs up even though it's never a place I would suggest going to unless my bf was in a bad mood and I wanted to placate him.The people who work here are really friendly. I've never had much to complain about when eating here, except I do wish their sides were better because they are kind of mediocre. Still, it's solid food for a great price. I can't really complain.
Unreal! Maybe the best rotisserie chicken I've ever had in my life. The glance at the chickens slowly charring over the wood fire is a sight to behold. I'm seriously considering trying to franchise one of these in downtown Cincinnati. It would slaughter the mediocre lunch options we currently have available. I won't waste your time covering the details of how the restaurant works as there are plenty of other reviews doing the same thing. Just know that the marinade and sauces perfectly compliment the crispy skin and juicy meat of the chicken. It comes with french fries and coleslaw, but they could serve it with cardboard and glue and I would still eat it. Just go!
Addicted to this chicken!
I grew up on this chicken in high school before it moved to the Kenmore Street location and the flavor hasn't changed since the mid-90s. It's simple:*Good Peruvian chicken served native style*Crunchy fries*Cash onlyAnd I like to mix the green and yellow sauces together. This is really good fast food when I don't want to do the dishes.
Basic Peruvian chicken joint. Does one thing and does it well. Is bare bones and cheap but that is what you go there for.
This place reminds me of home! I'm originally from Peru and the flavors of their chicken, fries, and sauces are as close as it gets to the authenticity of Pardos Chicken in Lima!! Amazing environment, usually playing Latin music and the staff is always friendly and willing to chat (briefly) when you're going through the line.What's even better is that I noticed the last time I was there they started carrying a few D'Onofrio ice cream choices. Awesome!! Talk about authentic, for Peruvians it doesn't get much better than D'Onofrio helados! Overall, a great place with the best Peruvian chicken in the area. Period. I've been here several times during my year and a half in the DC area. There always seems to be a line, no matter what time you go. However, no matter what time you go they always deliver amazing flavorful chicken.
I will never know why I didn't have EPR every week, if not every day when I was living in Arlington. Where else can I satisfy my craving for peruvian chicken that is relatively cheap?! I always go for half a chicken and fries! Chicken is always moist and flavorful. I always came here when it was quiet so I never had a problem with a line. It's also been recommended by Anthony Bourdain so how can you go wrong.
This place sells one main entree - CHICKEN. It comes with 2 choices of either white rice, fries or coleslaw. They have a few desserts too. This joint is plain Jane and looks like nothing from the outside.But let me tell you. If you want to eat the best tasting chicken anywhere, THIS IS THE PLACE. The chicken was seasoned beautifully, Ever bite you had a mouthful of joyous seasoning. And lastly, the chicken was moist.Their menu is as simple as it comes. But the flavor of the chicken is as complex and tasty as you will find anywhere. I can't describe how great the chicken is here. But when you come here and take your first bite, you will know exactly what I am talking about.It was so good, my friend and I ate here again for lunch the next day before we drove back home. And let me tell you, it was better than the first time!
This place is so.delicious. I've been multiple times for a quick lunch. There are only a few sides, which keeps things quick, easy and simple, and the chicken is fantastic. The line is almost always long, so I try and go closer to 2 or 3. As long as the chicken hasn't been sitting, it is amazing. The sauces are perfect, too, and they will usually give you some extra if you ask nicely.
This chicken place is awesome. You will immediately know this by the parking lot overflowing, the lines, and the amount of chicken going around the rotisserie wheel.  The food is very cost effective. It comes with delicious sides. They also take card. I would avoid of possible during lunch rush and evenings right after work. These times  are when the parking lot is packed, lines are long, and mayhem is in full effect.
Hands down, the best peruvian chicken around. Now if only they would also serve yucca fries, it would be perfect. Instead the chicken comes with fries, salad, and sauces. Not a bad combination but the addition of yucca would make it even better.
El Pollo Rico is one of the most popular and famous Peruvian joints in the area, and for a good reason. Their chicken is simply one of the most delicious, superior juiciness, unmatched spices, and best. Whereas all other Peruvian chicken places have brought their prices up, Pollo Rico has actually kept them at the same price, you can get a quarter chicken w/ extra sauces for less than $6. There are times when I don't feel like eating chicken, but I still eat El Pollo Rico anyways and get satisfied. My only gripe about this place is their chicken is a little bit too salty, I wish it was less salty for health reasons, and they don't have many choices of sides. Only Fries, rice, and cole slaw. Inexplicably, they do not have yuca, one of the staples of every Peruvian chicken restaurant. They would sell tons of yuca if they would sell it, but they go for mass production of chicken here and simple sides, not for variety. The few items they do sell though, are excellent, and that's what matters.
First time I ever had Peruvian chicken and it was amazing. Don't let the appearance fool you. The chicken is the business! Stay away from the cole slaw though : )
If I go anywhere else for Peruvian chicken, I always leave disappointed that I didn't eat Pollo Rico. I can't find anwhere else that compares. It's hard to pass by this place without stopping since the smell of this amazing roasted chicken covers a .5+ mile radius. It's a no frills type of place-- dark or white meat, whole or half, fries, rice, and/or coleslaw, # white sauce and # green sauce. The white sauce is amazing (if you normally ask for extra it is worth it to get the large size) and the green sauce has the perfect amount of spice. This is a place for folks that don't mind having chicken be the main focus of the meal. I usually only order fries to keep it that way. I wouldn't recommend this place to vegetarians. Nice plus that they have ice cold Mexican Cokes with cane sugar. I prefer taking it to go and they do a good job of packing it so it stays hot during transit.
Lovelovelove the chicken. Crave the chicken! Always a crowd and kid pleaser.Don't mind the atmosphere, even. After travelling the world, this place looks clean and friendly. Would love the option to not have to take a side. Would love some sides I actually want to eat. But it's not really about the sides, is it?
Not the most glamorous sit down place. I mostly do take out, especially when it gets super crowded around lunch. tasty chicken + fast turnover + always fresh + cash/credit + cheap. Parking is limited so plan accordingly!
Most succulent, crispy, juicy Peruvian Chicken. Love this place! Lots of sides to choose from, cheap, and definitely worth it. Would definitely come here again!
Some of the best Peruvian chicken I have ever had, and certainly the best in the DC metropolitan area. I recommend this place to anyone who loves great food and getting it fast. Before I could even finish ordering my food was plated, hot, and delicious.
The Peruvian chicken here may be even better than the Peruvian chicken in Peru.They keep it simple, only sides are fries, cole slaw and rice, so don't be surprised. They don't need to add anything else though, the line is still out the door during peak hours.
Although Pollo Rico has perfectly seasoned tender chicken it could be more crispy. They don't have yucca or black beans and their green sauce isn't the best I've had. With all that said they still spit out really good chicken at a really good price and are consistent.
Best Peruvian chicken spot in town. One of the originals and does it about as traditional as it gets. Perfect.
Juicy, flavorful chicken and nice sides at a price you can't beat. They have stayed consistant over the many years I have stopped in. Shows it pays to excel in one thing than to try doing a ton and coming out mediocre. Honestly, best peruvian pollo stop I have ever visited.
I can't believe I haven't written a review for this place sooner! I have been going to the place for over 15 years in all their various locations. The people who serve you are still the same people from that long ago. They are always very nice and always have amazing chicken! This place does get very packed around dinner and lunch. Parking can be difficult since there is only a small parking lot. The price for the food is incredibly reasonable. The menu is very simple, pick the type of meat (white or dark), fries, and coleslaw. I also suggest trying the inca cola. This is the best peruvian chicken I've ever had, and I refuse to go to the copy cats in the area.
Best chicken in the Arlington area. However, I still can't believe they don't serve fried yucca!!!
Hands down the best chicken in the area. The other one being Super Pollo. They don't have a lot of choice for sides, but they know people are there for the chicken. Can get very crowded on weekends and during lunchtime. Interior is very casual and loud. Definitely try it!
This place is great. Amazingly flavorful chicken, spiced and roasted perfectly. Yeah, the service isn't the friendliest, the restaurant isn't immaculate, and they dont have a lot of options on the menu, but the value and tastiness of their Peruvian chicken makes up for that. Service: 3 starsCleanliness: 4 starsFood: 6 STARS!! Value: 5 StarsOverall: 4.5 Stars (I rounded that up to 5)
600 reviews can't be wrong. Yes, the chicken/sauce/steak fries combo has crack-like properties. I would pay a lot of money to know the spice mix that they marinate the chicken in. The line can be long, but it moves quickly. They actually take card now, which is great (but they def still prefer cash). The parking lot is a joke. My sister's car was practically pinned in by a crazed chicken-seeking fiend to the point where we had to wait until they came out to have any chance of getting out without hitting them. Other than that, it's delicious chicken. I really wish they had yucca fries, though. Crisp and Juicy is still slightly better in my opinion.
BEST ROAST CHICKEN IN THE AREA. those other places don't even compare.only problem here is the parking.
1.5 stars. El Pollo Rico: Y U NO HAVE BEANS AND RICE ???!! What is this?! Am I living in another dimension? How can you call yourself a purveyor of Latin American cuisine and not have beans and rice? A meal your ancestors have been eating for generations!I have never been so surprised in my life. And that's no exaggeration. When I asked for rice and beans with my chicken, the guy at the counter looked at me like I was crazy. Like I was crazy! I still can't believe it. The chicken was charred and not flavorful. It wasn't abhorrent but it also wasn't omgthebestchickenever. I've already gone over the side situation. How people consistently choose to come here over Super Pollo (a far superior choice, within metro/walking distance of this place, AND one that offers rice and beans among a myriad of side options) is beyond any logical thought. Add tiny parking lot and nonexistant parking options and you can see why this place is skippable.
Very high quality chicken. I take my family and friends here when they visit because it's so delicious. Weekdays there are a lot of suits... stick to the weekends, it's not as slammed. Their yellow sauce is sweet and flavorful (I think it's honey mustard and mayo).
This place does chicken well. If you are in it for ambiance or a variety of menu options, you're heading to the wrong place. If you want delicious chicken at a very reasonable price, then this is the place!
I'm not really sure why this place has been rated so high? The chicken is ok, but everything else is really really bad. Let's talk about the sides, the coleslaw is nearly all runny mayo, the rice is plain white rice and the fries are average at best. No plantains or tostones in a Peruvian place? Really? Not to mention it feels and looks sort of like a hospital caffeteria. And for the grand finale there's limited parking. For what, an ok chicken, horrible sides and hospital ambiance? No thank you!For anyone who rated this place above 2 stars (even that's being generous), I recommend you try Sardi's in College Park Maryland. I know we Virginians don't like going to Maryland, but trust me, if you think this dump is remotely decent, you'll be blown away by Sardi's. For a similar price you get better chicken, awesome choice of sides (and a lot of it) and there's parking. Not to mention, you don't feel like your in a hospital. Sardi's (next door to Arby's) is what I consider a true "dive with great food". The other great thing about Sardi's is they offer more than just chicken. The grilled steak and shrimp is crazy good too although for your first time, I do highly recommend the chicken.For those of you who can make it out to College Park, I dare you to try Sardi's and then come back and tell me what you really think about El Pollo Rico. I'm confident you'll wanna go back and change your rating after comparing the two.
Roast Chicken like crack.Oh my God, So F-in Good.Please give me some more.
I don't love getting a food comatose, but at El Pollo Rico, I'm game. All you need here is a $5 1/4 white chicken and some fries, combined with phenomenal dipping sauces. I've had Peruvian Chicken elsewhere in DC and beyond, and this is far and away the best. But, please don't go here...I can't get parking easily and don't want to wait in line. I want this place all to myself.
Awesome chicken - always moist and goes great with their yellow sauce. Prices are VERY low and everything tastes great. Only downside is that the line can be long sometimes and it may be difficult to find parking.
I'll keep this review short and sweet. What else can I say that hasn't been said by over 600 other reviews?El Pollo Rico's chicken is the gold standard for Peruvian chicken. PERIOD. No one has juicier, more flavorful chicken, and I've been to Super Pollo. The best way to deal with the parking issue is to tag team this restaurant. Have a friend drop you off while you order the food and they drive around. That was you can make a quick getaway when you've got the goods!
Price is cheap! But, food is good taste!I often take-out here.
Limited menu, good chicken!!
If you like bland, dry, tasteless chicken then RUN. Run the other direction because you are not getting that here! They make one thing and they make it good. The proof is in the ridiculous line that forms here every single day waiting for rotisserie heaven. Forget trying to park in their lot, its full. If your not in the door by noon your gonna wait in a line like the DMV's. The good news though is that the chicken is ABSOLUTELY the BEST chicken. My wife and I devour a whole chicken between us. It's insane. They must make 1000 chickens a day. Chicken killing fools. Put that bird on a spit and turn over hot coals. Perfection! Can I get a witness?
Good chicken. Good prices.
If chicken and french fries are your thing, this is the place. 5 stars because it is unique and the chicken was tasty but the lack of more interesting sides will probably keep me from coming back too often.
A ridiculous amount of food if you order the half chicken which comes with two sides. Half chicken, two sides, and a soda for under $10. That can't be beat in Arlington for the quantity of food served. The quality is also very good but the sauce provided is limited and they charge for extras. I tried the Inca Cola here (actually made by Coca Cola if you read the can!). I'll stick with regular Coca Cola next time. There is no atmosphere here and parking is limited so use the Virginia Square metro. Don't let the look of the place from the outside scare you away. This is the type of dive I would never normally venture into if not for the existence of Yelp reviews...
Often imitated, but never duplicated. Staple in the Arlington/Clarendon community for many years. Service is quick, chicken is delicious, price is reasonable. One of those Travel Channels spotlighted El Pollo Rico as a place to visit while in D.C. So not only do the locals know how good the chicken is, but the word has spread. You won't be disappointed.
I don't know how anyone could give this place anything less than 5 stars! Our go-to place when we need a quick dinner. The chicken is AMAZING and actually very healthy. Which makes up for the not-so-healthy-but-addicting fries dipped in that heavenly yellow sauce...my mouth is watering. No other peruvian chicken place in the area comes close to making a meal like they do.
Where else can you get a tasty dinner for under $6? The Peruvian rotisserie chicken here is quite good. It's moist and flavorful. The downside is that the sides are limited (only french fries, rice or coleslaw), and you have to know that you can ask for different combinations of the three (french fries and coleslaw are the standard).While the prices have increased over the years, it's still one of the cheapest places to get a good meal fast. However, you may be waiting awhile when there's a line as sometimes there are large phone orders. Go hungry at an off time.
Don't even feel I need to do a review for this place, just go and try it, then you will become hooked. Doesn't matter how long the line is, always worth the wait. Parking is limited, but come on, there is a reason for that. Best peruvian chicken i've had.
I freakin' love peruvian chicken. i've been to more than 5 different peruvian chicken places and I have to say this place is as best as peruvian chicken gets. The flavors on the chicken is just so freakin' delicious. The chicken is never dry and with the green sauces that they give you....mmmh! If you ask for more green sauce, they do charge you extra even if it's a tablespoon of it in a little plastic cup. The price is very fair for the amount of food that you get.
Found this gem of a place a few weeks ago after a business meeting in Arlington and all I can say is wow. As the old cliche goes, sometimes the "hole in wall" restaurants are the best restaurants as is the case here. There was a line out of the front door and parking was a bear, had to park and walk 2 blocks, but it ended up being worth it. Wait staff? nah, ambiance? nah, fancy silverware? nah. The best chicken I have ever had the pleasure of dining on? Absolutely! I ordered the half chicken with fries and coleslaw. You order at the counter and they cut the chicken with a meat clever right then and there. The fries were of the steak variety and were so so and the cole slaw was a bit runny, but what do you want for the price? This chicken more than makes up for it and their dipping sauces are fantastic. All in all the best Peruvian chicken I have ever tasted, can't wait to skip out of work and go back...
This is the best peruvian chicken in DC. The atmosphere is terrible and there is always a line, but it moves fast. Parking lot is usually packed. That's about it. Eat it, it's great.
With all the hype and watching Anthony Bourdain eating at El Pollo Rico, I have been anticipating to try El Pollo Rico for quite some time... and boy was I disappointed!!! The chicken was masked in a pepper rub that was extremely overpowering. I know I'll never be going back.
Holy chicken! This well-known hole-in-the-wall is good! Be prepared to wait a little to get your food; but once you taste that seasoned chicken with that yellow sauce, all that wait will be worth it!! Very tender and generous-sized quarter chicken. Got the white rice and fries as sides. The sides are fine, but the chicken is what got me. And the prices are also very cheap- I spent around $6 for the whole meal!! I will definitely come by again.
This place is soooo good and tasty! The best Peruvian chicken in the area. Affordable, convenient location and quick service! It's usually busy around peak time but the line goes pretty fast. Lots of seating and they have a parking lot so I've never had problem with parking. Side orders are limited to rice, cole slaw and steak fries. Other places offer more variety for sides but I don't really care about the sides. The yellow sauce is the best!!! I would highly recommend this place!
one word. amazing.
Peruvian Chicken at it's finest! Simply delightful. I chose the half chicken which was perfect for me. It comes with two side, I chose rice and fries. The green spicy sauce and the white sauce that come with it bring out the flavors. We got our food to go so I can't review the dining area. They do take credit cards (atleast Visa). Parking was a little more difficult as we had to search for a little bit.
I love this place. I am here a few times a month. I love their chicken - flavorful, moist (but not at all mushy like another place that had good reviews), delicious meat, even tasty skin and I never eat the skin. It's delicious both when you get it and having it for leftovers. I like it the next day in a salad.I only get fries (no coleslaw) and the fries are crispy yet moist, just perfect and addictive - with or without the sauces. I usually have to crack open the take out container to taste test some fries on the way home.It's my hands down favorite Peruvian chicken in the area. And has been for years.
One of the simplest places to order and simultaneously one of the best rotisserie chicken meals I've ever had. Your only choices are 1/4, 1/2, or a whole chicken and then fries or coleslaw. Simple, cheap, and consistently amazing.pro tip: at the end get some of the hot sauce (green) and some of the regular (white), mix them together and slather or dip anything in the resulting combo!
The best peruvian chicken place in the area. The spices are just right in comparison to some of their other pollo ala brasa competitors that use tumeric or cumin in their rubs. The fries are very good too. Maybe they're just good because the chicken is just that good.Parking is limited, so go during a non-rush time. Another note, right before Hurrican Sandy, the line was out the door on that Sunday night at 8 pm. Just shows how good this place actually is. When the lights go out, people just want their El Pollo Rico.
Best Peruvian Chicken I've ever had. There are a lot of similar places but this place has consistently been better.Chicken - Simply Amazing, awesome marination, spiced just rightFries - Steak Fries, hard to mess these up anywhereCole Slaw - Not a big fan of coleslaw but works to perfection with the chicken, fries and saucesSauces - Love both the hot (green) & mild (white/yellow) sauces. Though im pretty sure the white sauce is not healthy at all.A lot of people like super pollo, super chicken and a couple other knock offs but i think this is simply the best.
Yummy yummy deliciousness!!!!!! I love this chicken and I am (oddly) not a fan of chicken. Yes, I know, I'm the one person on the planet who doesn't like chicken. However... LOOOVE this place, the sauces, the seasoning, the french fries... SO GOOD! Just dropping one star because the interior could use a facelift. I guess if your food is that good it really doesn't matter that much.
El Pollo Rico can look a bit shabby from the outside, but don't let appearances deceive you. The chicken here is prepared just right. Whenever I eat out, white meat is usually overcooked and way too dry. The white meat at El Pollo Rico is as good as the dark, which says a lot! The chicken is a little on the salty side, but SO good nonetheless. When my friends and family visit from out of town, this will definitely be one of our stops
Great chicken
Best Peruvian chicken I've ever had! I like it when the chicken is slightly burned. It makes it taste even better! Also the prices are very convenient.
This place is definitely fun, it has a very authentic feel. It's cheap and the chicken is very good. It gets 4 stars however due to a lack of side orders. Outside of chicken your choices are french fries, white rice, or coleslaw. due to its limited menu I would definitely recommend Caribbean Grill over El Pollo Rico. I'm actually going to go back and update my review of Caribbean Grill to five stars for this reason.
I adore this place. Best everything ever. Try the alfajores for dessert too!
Quick review:Amazingly delicious and cheap chickenVery bland sides.Really, it is worth it for the chicken.
Simple menu, delicious food! Best chicken in the area by far. Loved the sauces, but the coleslaw wasn't my favorite and I wish they served beer (easier said than done i know). Super inexpensive to. We'll be back.
I don't get it? Everyone seems to think this place has the greatest chicken. I went with my family because of the reviews. I'm new to NoVa (military) originally from CA but lived the last 6 yrs in HI. The chicken is just OK, I've had better, much better. Was very disappointed because I've been trying really hard to find a new Latino or Mexican place. Not worth the price too, I thought it was pricey for the portion; we got a very small chicken. You are better off getting a chicken at Costco for 4.99 and just as juicy and tasty but bigger. Does anyone know of a really good Latin American or Mexican place?? Also I tried out Los Tios in Del Ray cause they also said it was "authentic" Mexican. It was just ok too! Salsa is NOT suppose to be watery like juice! That's Mexican food 101, I can make better salsa with a blindfold. I can give ppl a recipe: Real ripe tomatoes, cilantro, onions, jalapenos, squeeze of lime, pinch of salt and sugar=then blend or chop if you like it chunky. If you don't have tomatoes, canned whole or diced tomatoes works very well. I've got other real Mexican recipes & I'm not even Mexican, just hit me up. I grew up with the culture all around.
No yucca? I was disappointed at the lack of menu options. I ordered the 1/4 chicken with 2 sides and opted for the fries and coleslaw. The chicken tastes ok but my 1/4 piece of chicken tasted like it had been under a heat lamp too long. The green sauce was meh and they charge for extra sauce. Do not order the coleslaw...  How is coleslaw at a Peruvian place a specialty? I don't know what I was thinking except that I wanted to be a healthy by choosing coleslaw rather than rice.  I've had better but surprisingly the parking lot and restaurant was packed. So maybe it's just a matter of taste. I may go again for whole chickens only.
The real deal. Perfect succulent, flavorful quarter chicken meal with chicha morada for $7. Excellent salted rice, green spicy aji verde, and aioli. Just like the specialty rotisserie joints in MIA and LA. Perfectly basted rotating plump birds dripping over open charcoal flame to the tune of Spanish music and the pounding of the cleaver on the chopping board. Ah.
Best Chicken I have ever had hands down!!!! When I walked in on a Sunday evening, the line had about 30 people in it and it went very quickly. The chicken was worth the wait and I cant wait to go back very soon. The sides are average, but hey, thats what happens when the main dish is outstanding!
Yum yumAfter watching a Breaking Bad marathon, I crave fictitious Los Pollos Hermanos. Well, thinking about TV during a workout brings for distraction but luckily there is El Pollo Rico! I ordered the quarter chicken and two sides. Great portion! I saw the rice was simply plain white so I thought I'd try coleslaw and fries. Fries are good, especially with the uber spicy green sauce! Coleslaw reminded me of a white sloppy mess. Take a pass with this one. Chicken! Juicy! Flavor bursting through the seams! Four stars bc of the lack of sides but honestly I think I'll get a half chicken and skip them next time. Low carb, right?
Truly excellent chicken. Terrible sides, but they come with meal. Extremely cheap.
i've been waiting to try this out as I hear it's the best in the area. it doesn't disappoint. the pieces are huge. the spices come out with a smoky/charred taste. the chicken is really juicy and tender. i enjoyed the buttered rice and the cole slaw sides. in fact, i somewhat like the rice better than the chicken. as for the ajis, the green seems like it's really fresh as if it was made the same morning. that's not enough time for the peppers to simmer in spiciness, but it is still tasty, if not spicy. as for the negative, i secretly enjoy the chicken liver, and subtly try to pop that into my mouth when no one is looking. i'm not always successful at it, though. el pollo rico does not have much of that as it's mostly replaced by their dry rub. also, if you're a water fan, get it from the bottle. otherwise, the ice they use for the tap water tastes funny.
Wow, this place was surprisingly really good.When I arrived there, I saw the parking lot full and people constantly walking in and out..so I thought that this place must be quite special.When I went in, the line moved pretty quickly. The servers had this thing perfected. The menu was simple and you only had a few choices, but those few choices are all you really needed.I got a quarter chicken with fries and cole slaw. I also got a canned soda. The total came out to ~$6-7? I don't really remember, but it was inexpensive.I sat down to eat and wow, the fries were great and the chicken was awesome. Not dry or anything, but near perfect. Usually, I'm not a big fan of cole slaw, but I ate all of it. There was plenty of seating in a nice spacious area. As for the enviroment, there is nothing special, but we're here for the food.I wish they gave us more sauce, though. But, the world is imperfect, so it may just be too much to ask for.I would totally go here again (especially since the price is so right), thus the 5 star rating.
We call this place "The Chicken" instead of El Pollo Rico as the chicken is so juicy and well seasoned. The mild and hot sauce are great and great mixed. The Steak fires are solid too especially dipped in sauce. If you don't like coleslaw you just order fries only and indicate 1/4 or 1/2 and white or dark. Best rotisserie chicken I have ever had.
We were in the area looking for a good restaurant that wouldn't break the bank and found El Pollo Rico by accident.  After eating there, we were very happy to have stumbled upon the place. The Peruvian chicken is to die for and the side dishes are delicous too. The prices are very reasonable, and there is ample parking (which is hard to find in Arlington).  Highly recommended!
Hands down the best Peruvian chicken in the area!1. The line is fast2. Their menu is not complicated like other spots3. The chicken is amazing!4. For under $10.. Yeah can't beat it5. Enough seating for everyoneGetting into the most important part.. the chicken. At first I love how you can choose between white or dark chicken. I know a few people that are quite picky with their chicken so this definitely helps. Plus whether you choose the dark or the white chicken meat, the seasoning... THAT SEASONING! Such an amazing taste that you are able to savor the chicken and keeps you wanting for more. Unlike Super Pollo, the chicken meat here is quite moist! Super Pollo (its main competitor) is good, but the taste and chicken meat is a bit dry. Now if you like your chicken slightly hard and on the dry side then by all means I would recommend Super Pollo. I prefer my chicken to be moist which in the end I can savor its taste. The steak fries are great as well! Sure I have heard some people complain about the fries being slightly greasy.. BUT THEY ARE FRIES! Very crispy, golden, and yummy fries which I recommend getting as a side. They also have coleslaw and rice which you are able to choose from when ordering. I recommend ordering a 1/2 chicken, steak fries, rice, and agua de coco (coconut juice).Menu Below With Prices:1/4 Chicken $5.901/2 Chicken $91/2 Chicken (White Meat) $11.15Whole Chicken $16.40Coleslaw $1.95Steak Fries $2.85Rice $1.95Extra Sauce $0.35Alfajores $1.80Flan $2.90Cake Slice $2.90Milhojas $2.90Food: Affordable ($) / DeliciousService: Quick / FriendlyCrowd: Variety / Weekends get busy!
This Peruvian place lived up to its reputation. The chicken was amazing! Believe the hype!
El Pollo Rico could've been a 5. Why? No yucca... WHY?!The chicken here is moist, delicious, and has the right amount of seasoning. That is really all you need to know. The fries are good but there is no excuse for not having yucca as a side. Only fries, coleslaw, and rice. Otherwise El Pollo Rico has the best chicken in the area hands down.
It's just ok... if you've ever been to Peru, you know that this place is VERY far from the real deal. If you enjoyed this place, you'd be in heaven in Peru. This place compares to a the equivalent of a McDonald's polleria in Peru. However, I think it is probably one of the better places in the area, so I'd recommend trying it over other places. The chicken is very small though. Service is quick and plenty of tables.
The most perfectly-cooked chicken in the world - sweet, sticky, moist, extremely tender. Spices are incredible - I usually avoid eating chicken skin, but not here. ...And the prices are very good. Biggest complaint is the volume of accompanying sauces; you definitely want to order another 2-3. (I like to mix the mayo and minced pepper - green sauce - and I always run out of both if I'm dipping pieces of chicken and fries.)The chicken is definitely the specialty: the fries are like little pieces of cardboard, and the slaw is basically a bowl of mayonnaise flavored with a few pieces of cabbage. Parking can be a bit of an issue; the lot's always full, and it's not the best layout. (An employee blocked me in on my last visit. The manager (or maybe owner?) was very helpful and had her move it right away, but it was still annoying. Bare-bones, linoleum-floored dining area, but it works for this food.Despite the shortcomings, the chicken is so phenomenal that this place still rates a 5. Nice to see a place keep up this level of good food for at least a decade now.
Best.Chicken.Ever!!!The prices are good, the portions are great (all I need is a quarter chicken and the sides), and the chicken is amazing! They could have more side options but I continue to come back for the chicken despite trying other chicken places that do offer more. I love El Pollo Rico!
Always quick, even if there's a long line. Pretty delicious. Couldn't taste that much of a difference between their chicken and a rotisserie chicken from Boston Market, but either way, I like both. Fries are the thick steak fries variety which here tend to be pretty soggy/floppy, but the sauces they provide make them taste better. Stingy on the sauces though! You definitely don't get enough to use for your whole meal.
I've been back here several times, as it's been convenient and my stomach has craved rotisserie deliciousness. I must say that the service and quality of the food is consistently good. I still find myself at Super Pollo more frequently, but I really love the tenderness and flavor of the chicken here and the staff are incredibly friendly and efficient with large crowds.
This is my go to place for Peruvian chicken in Arlington. The chicken is just fantastic and very flavorful. I just keep it real simple and just grab the chicken along with the fries,This place is always crowded with the usual lunch crowd and the parking lot stays full. I like the service, the staff is very friendly and attentive. There is never any errors. They have superb customer service. I have yet to have a bad experience here.
I give it 3.5 starsI was expecting nothing short of perfection after reading all the reviews on here. I hung around the parking lot for a while waiting for some friends, and I mean the place was swarming with cars coming in and out non-stop. The chicken is done really well, very juicy and the seasoning is on point (maybe a little salty). But the sauces are just disappointing, the yellow is too thick, and the green has no flavor and really isn't spicy like it should be. Also, like everyone is saying, the sides - I'm not sure if you can order without any sides but if I go back I will skip the plain fries, plain white rice, and coleslaw that is 50\% mayo. Anyway, I'm gonna try the other places around, and hopefully I'll find what I'm looking for (some good sauce, solid chicken, and yuca). I didn't know it but I was spoiled at JMU - if you're ever in harrisonburg, look up A&T's chicken, I could eat there daily.
Floored by how out-of-this-world juicy this place's chicken is. The chicken is that good. Do yourself a favor and go check it out.
This looked sooooo good on television and based on the reviews I've read, the chicken sounds sooooo good and when we entered and saw the chicken roasting behind the counter, you could hear that seductive greasy crackle and it sounded oh sooooo good. Sigh, even when we sat down and had the chicken in front of us, it felt so greasy and juicy just waiting for my friends to get their plates felt like an eternity. So why why why whhhyyyy did our chicken taste sooooo dry???I thought it was just me. But unfortunately, survey says that all 4 chicken plates were parched. Now this might be coming off a little extreme which it probably is but to be expecting a nice succulent, ketchup-free chicken meal and bite into anything less than that is enough to make anyone a tad bit irritated. I'll say that the drumsticks were fantastic but as I've noted before, that's not hard. The breast from the get-go just wasn't cutting it. Even with their sauces (which on a different tone, holy crap those were delicious. I might've kept eating the chicken just because I wanted to keep dipping in the sauce) you could still taste the dryness. I will say this though. They use some pretty amazing seasoning cause the chicken skin tasted fantastic. But unfortunately, the flavor didn't really penetrate into the meat. I guess you get a side of rice which is nice?Sad to say, my El Pollo Rico experience was a little lackluster but to be fair, there had been quite a bit of hype built up around this place. It is definitely a solid Peruvian spot and I'm quite sure on good days, their chicken stands supreme. Unfortunately, I didn't come on one of those good days.
Hands down the best Peruvian chicken you'll find in the area! I've yet to meet someone who hasn't like this place and it's very affordable.
I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here because I find other pollo places nearby to be good too. However, El Pollo Rico is popular for a reason. Their seasoning definitely stands out from the others. I'll make this one of my 'lazy' review because there are over +500 reviews with probably the same opinion as me =)
I gotta hand it to this place. On the day following the super fun power outage storm of 2012, El Pollo Rico stayed open. My friend and I trekked all around Arlington, trying to find a means to get cash since all ATMs were out of order and banks closed. When we finally did acquire some sweet moolah, we headed straight to EPR for some delicious Peruvian style chicken in 100 degree heat. Sound crazy? Well, yeah, it was. But the chicken made it worth it.Now I've been here several times and always loved it but I still must complain about the lack of sides. You can order your chicken (quarter, half, whole) and rice, cole slaw, and fries. That's it. Any 2 of the 3 come with your meal. And what you get is saddeningly mediocre. But the chicken is banging and is, without question, the best Peruvian chicken in the area.Now if only we could combine EPR's chicken, Super Pollo's sides, and Crisp and Juicy's sauce ... now THAT would be an epic Peruvian chicken dinner!
How do you know you're a 90's kid? When you got Pollo Rico when it was next to 7-11. Been loving Pollo since I was little kid. Now that I don't live in the area anymore. I make sure this is the first stop I make when coming into town.
This place is the real deal.  lived in VA for a year when I was a kid and we frequented this place often. As an adult, I've just gone back during a recent trip back to VA and I'm still a huge fan. The people who work here are helpful, friendly and fast. The chicken is amazingly juicy, tender and flavorful. I love everything about this place, even the family feel about the seating area. Lots of people, lots of laughter, lots of chicken!
If you're looking for romance and refinement this is NOT it. But the joint offers terrific rotisserie chicken at ridiculous prices. The chicken's spit roasted with Peruvian spices and it's moist and tender, even the breast meat. I opted for a quarter chicken (thigh- they take requests) with coleslaw and fries at about $5 which is like absurdly cheap for the grand portions. My husband got the half chicken for like $7 with the same sides. The coleslaw tastes a bit institutional and the steak fries were good. Having been to Peru, I can attest this is authentic down to the fries. Maybe not the coleslaw, I'm not sure. Anyway, I'd definitely go back. We went on a Sunday and the place was packed to the gills and they do phenomenal business.
I am not going to waste your time. I will only ask you to go there and not bother with any review here. These guys are totally worth the time and travel. You NEED to taste and try their chicken only to know how amazing rotisserie chicken can be, and how such a bland place and decor can still command such a following because of the product they offer. Other "restaurants" can do much better if they learn from these guys on how to focus and do - ONE, just ONE - thing amazingly well.
EL POLLO ES FANTASTICO!! as a poor student, this place was a goldmine. You cannot go wrong with a delicious, whole, succulent chicken, large fries or yucca and 4 soda cans for 19.95. I dined with one other person and I had enough leftovers to survive me for a week in school..
Excellent place. I think the best Peruvian chicken I've ever had. Price is good too.A few cons:- Very busy during lunch hours.- They don't take credit or debit cards. - Music is too loud sometimes
The chicken here was great!! If you are looking for a good and cheap meal this is the place. Atmosphere not the best, but the meal totally makes up for it. Anthony Bourdain stopped here for his show "No Reservations", which is why I decided to try it. Definitely worth checking out.
I live in Centreville but I still drive from time to time to get my fix of PERUVIAN CHICKEN o POLLO A LA BRASA! This is the BEST PERUVIAN CHICKEN in ALL NORTHERN VIRGNIA. Give it a try, don't expect variety in the menu, this is the place to get PERUVIAN CHICKEN only. The fries are really really good, mixed the green spicy sauce with the yellow sauce and you get perfection! The chicken is so tender and juicy it will come right off the bone... yummy!Uhhhh now I am hungry, mouth watering.... I think I will drive there tonight.
Came to El Pollo Rico because I am on a low carb diet. I am a fan of rotisserie chicken, not having the tools to make it home. The chicken was dry and the only thing that saved it was the mayo based sauce. Have these people heard of putting the chicken in brine before cooking? Would improve the flavor and dryness of the breast.i've had better rotisserie chicken at Costco and the food truck Roli Roti (for you Bay area folks). In addition, my brined non-rotisserie smoked chicken is better than El Pollo Rico. Regarding the Costco rotisserie chicken I have had, it is made with CA (Bay area) raised chickens. Can't say I've had Costco rotisserie chicken from eastern MD birds; it might not be as good.
Amazing chicken!!! Forget the sides - who needs them with chicken that good.
WOW - maybe the best roast chicken outside of LIma. This is a great place to taste the flavors of Peru's national treasure pollo ala brasa!
Just like the 'cantinas' in Peru. The chicken is good, that much is true. I found the fries a bit too crisp for my liking. And as to the 'ambiente': there's a reason most people take out, I suppose...
Peruvian chicken is unknown to much of the country, but here it's its own genre. Often located in converted fast food restaurants and other colorful venues, they serve mainly roasted chicken with sides that are at best an afterthought. Pollo Rico has been around long enough to have a cleaner, larger, more established location. The menu remains unchanged. You order from an industrious line, pick out the quantity and color of your chicken, the color of your sauce, and two cannot-possibly-be-authentic sides. They have a hot green sauce which must consist mainly of a pepper and a yellowish white sauce which must be mostly mayonnaise. They have coleslaw, steak fries, and rice. Somehow these have become the natural accompaniments to Peruvian chicken, and they're good enough. The chicken, to use the name of another chain in the area, is at once crisp and juicy. The roasting process perfectly crisps the exterior, while locking in the moisture. It's not heavily seasoned though, so the sauces are a nice pairing. If you're starting on the Peruvian chicken genre, El Pollo Rico is a good place to start.
This place is the spot. The chicken is sooo good, and it is also very cheap. I absolutely recommend going here, even if you have to take a 20 minute train ride from downtown DC.
To be honest, I was expecting more than chicken on the menu but it was basically "chicken, more chicken, or a whole lotta chicken"... being a bit disappointed, I ordered a quarter chicken with 2 sides (coleslaw and fries) regardless. I was satisfied though! Really tender Peruvian chicken but I think the sides were really on point. The coleslaw was delicious and the fries were steak fries.The place wasn't a hole in the wall because it actually was a decent size and had a lot of tables. Wish I tried the flavored icecream but I was full! It was great portions and of course, affordable. Good stuff!
We order chicken from this place at work every so often when everyone's stressed out and it always brightens everyone's day. There are over 40 of us who participate. Today I decided to treat myself to some chicken after a doctor's appointment in the area to try to brighten my own day. Plus I wanted to see what the establishment looked like. While I love their chicken, it totally RUINED my day today. I ordered a 1/2 chicken white with rice and coleslaw Since I live over 30 miles away, I wanted to have some chicken left over for later. Anyway, the chicken guy made a mistake and gave me a 1/4 dark. And when I corrected the order at the register, the cashier gave the tray back to the chicken guy, and the chicken guy basically called me FAT (gorda) in Spanish and the two of them started laughing. My spanish is not the best despite being of latino heritage. But like anyone who has ever taken spanish in school, i understand simple sentences, all of the curse words, and especially the insults. I didn't want to cause a scene and disrupt the line (because it felt like I was in a bad soup-Nazi episode where everyone knew the routine but me, and wouldn't stand for any fussing), so i just paid for my food and left. But all the way home I was pissed at myself for not saying something about it then and there. Who is this chicken guy to call me fat for wanting a 1/2 a chicken?? I'm so annoyed that I'm not participating in any more orders at work from this place. I might go one step further and tell my coworkers what went down. There's another place we order from sometimes that's just as good, and with better sides.
SO. GOOD. Remember, cash only, but they have an ATM!
Yep, this is as good as it gets! The chicken here is amazing! Even their fries are good. The place itself is pretty bare bones, but that's part of the appeal.
Food was good but nothing that I would seek out. This is a greasy spoon restaurant that based on clientele is probably pretty authentic. Chicken was very good but sides were bland. With so many good international restaurants in the Nova area I probably won't return, but I have nothing against the place.
I've eaten the real deal in Peru, so I am a harsh critic. Yet, El Pollo Rico delivers a solid, authentic Peruvian-style experience from the food to the ambiance. And yes, the ubiquitous steak fries and spicy dipping sauce is true to how it traditionally comes served. The plethora of spices that adorn the chicken (do get the dark meat please) marry well with the simple, clean flavors of the fried potatoes and green sauce (steer clear of the white). Grab an Inca Kola and you are set with a delicious meal on the cheap. And for free, you will have a temporary escape to Peru...
Just finished licking the last bits of delicious chicken off my fingertips and had to give this place another 5 stars. Truly the best chicken in the area, nothing else compares. Their alfajores are delicious too and very authentic -- remind me of my days scarfing these down in Buenos Aires!
Best. Chicken. Ever. And DAMN SURE the best in A-Town
Dirt cheap, delicious, and great!
A long time ago, I gave up on finding a good family-owned Mexican fast-food joint here in northern Virginia. They simply do not exist, or so it seems. So I decided to try this place The chicken is great. The spices they use penetrate all the way into the chicken. Every bite is tasty. I jokingly asked the workers if they had any tortillas, a side of refried beans and some jalapenos. They said no. So I took my order to go. At home, I grabbed a tortilla, added some of the fries, refried beans, spicy salsa, sour cream, some rice, and finally, lots of the peruvian chicken. This the best California chicken burrito I've ever had.
It's not for nothing that Bourdain made the trip to the Rico. They have perfected the model of doing 1 menu item really really well. One of the best meals for the money in DC.
Fantastic roast chicken! Other Yelpers have already provided enough description, so I won't repeat. Quality seems to be consistent despite getting more and more popular over the years.There is not much service but the people working behind the counter are really friendly. Once I called around 9:50pm to ask if they were still open (they close at 10pm), the fellow answered the phone said "sure, we will wait"; didn't even ask how far we were. Impressive.
3 Stars because it was decent. Not near the best Peruvian chicken I have ever had.My big problem was that I got half white chicken and it was both too salty and too dry. It was good with the mayonnaise based sauce, but really, just adding a fat sauce makes anything taste better; the sauce shouldn't be necessary to balance it out. But the chicken was all and all okay. Rice and steak fries were tasty.Also, I feel like an authentic Peruvian joint should probably have better side dishes. Fries, rice, and coleslaw ain't much of a choice if you have to pick two. I was really hoping for something along the lines of yucca or plantains. But that's just me.
I love me some Pollo. Delicious chicken, good spicy sauce, fast. Doesn't get easier for a lunchtime meal. Wish they had some sort of vegetable side but I really can't complain. This chicken is like crack
I am so happy that this place is still open. I used to eat pollo rico when I was 9 when they had a different location near 10th street in a strip mall. This chicken is amazing! Now they offer rice, fries and coleslaw and now they also take credit cards!!! Avoid the luch rush between noon and 2pm call your order in ahead of time and skip to the front of the line.
Still hands down amazing chicken. I'm often open to trying other Peruvian chicken joints but it still doesn't hold a steak fry candle to El Pollo Rico, the original. They do now offer white rice as a side, for those of you who prefer this to the fries. Basically they've had the same formula that they have had for well over 15 years (yes yelpers), I've been coming to this place for so long when it was at its old location that was torn down.  Also they let you pay by credit card now too. I have yet to have a bad meal here, and the rub they use is pretty authentic to real Peruvian spices. The eat in atmosphere is pretty plain but if you come here on a weekend you'll see plenty of families sitting at several tables put together enjoying a great lunch that doesn't bust the budget.
When it comes to Peruvian chicken in the DC area, this place is by far the best... You've got to have it with Inca Cola and steak fries!
Mi pollo favorito en todo del mundo!Was taken here by some coworkers back in 2008 when I moved down here from NYC. Peruvian chicken? Really? How good could it be?F***ing AWESOME, that's how good!Slow roasted with fries and slaw.... I mix the mayo and minced jalapenos to give it a little more kick. Add a made in Mexico Coca-Cola and you're good to go.The ladies always make me laugh, despite my attempts to practice my Spanish when ordering.Saw Bourdain go there on No Reservations long after I had been there and laughed because I had the same first reaction... nothing special about the atmosphere and location. But it knocked my socks off.Have taken every single visitor that's come to see me there at least once... from family back in NYC to friends from Boston to Boise, each with the same result - people raving about it.
El Pollo Rico is as good as it gets when it comes to Peruvian Chicken.
Delicious!I just wish you could sub a salad or another side in lieu of the french fries.
Been going to Pollo Rico for that last few years--- and it has always and still remains the best Peruvia chicken place in Northern VA! I think the average person orders the quarter chicken with fries and colesaw. In the total of 15 times I've been here I've only had one not-so-great meal.That's a pretty awesome average for a place where your tummy is filled and your taste buds are screaming 'thank you little baby jesus' --- all for $5!
the bomb
Tasty chicken. Pretty juicy though the white meat was a touch dry. Good rub. The green sauce is jalepenos and more...the white was mayo. Fries were fine but not outstanding, bland and could use salt. Coleslaw was too much mayo and monotonous. Still, that's some good chicken.
Hidden treasure people!This place has 4 or 5 rotating chicken charcoal ovens whcih you see when you walk in.The chicken tastes amazing and the price was perfect, the place is very minimal but clean and big.I always try to sneak a visit to Pollo Rico when ever I'm at the area at lunch time.Great Place!
Hands down my favorite chicken place. I've sampled other Peruvian chicken spots and nothing compares to EPR. Not only is it super cheap ($6 for 1/4 chicken with two sides), but it's incredibly flavorful and moist...even the white meat! I'm drooling right now just thinking about it. Note: don't get freaked out by the line. They're fast and it's worth it.
This place quite possibly serves the best chicken you'll find anywhere. The chicken with the Peruvian green dipping sauce is just incredible. It comes with slaw and great fries for less than $10. This is the only 5-star restaurant I've rated.
Chicken is great, I would say on the level of Super Pollo, but their sides are lacking...just fries, coleslaw, and white rice? More variety in the side item dept would lead to 5 stars.
The Best peruvian spot in DC PERIOD. No one does it like them, It is well seasoned juicy and the fries and coleslaw is good to. I have been going here since i came to DC 2000. This is some of the best chicken I have ever tasted, Sometimes the line can be out the door but it is worth it. It hits the spot everytime and I do not give out 5 stars not to often, But this is not even a five star restaurant but the prices and taste are.Stay Tuned!!!!!!!!!!!! :) P.S. I am hungry now just thinkin about that chicken, If you ever get a chance please go to this place, It will not dissappoint.
El POLLO RICO! STOP GETTING MY ORDER WRONG!! Your food is sooo delicious, but you've gotten my order wrong the last 5 times! And, im not exaggerating. I go ther every week, which makes this even more frustrating. I always get the half order, dark meat, to go with rice and coleslaw. I dont like holding the line up. You dont like it when I hold the line up. STOP IT! Your service is not that great, but the food is soo good, I put up with it....but it hurts! I dont want to give up this good food because you keep f*n up! Get my order right, or else!
Best chicken I've ever had. Very consistent, it tastes the same almost every time. No frills interior, but a lot of tables and lots of space. And there is something nice about a place that only does one thing, with no options. It makes ordering so easy.
Super casual, but definitely gets the job done. Chicken is so juicy...only got the quarter but once I was finished, really regretted not getting the half.The coleslaw, the rice, the steak fries...oh and need to wash it all down with the inca cola of course.
love Love LOVE!Chicken is awesome, fresh and seasoned very well!Fries were crisp and plentiful. Nice big dining area to sit. Quick service. :)Awesome!
Phenomenal chicken, and the price is certainly right.The place, as some reviewers have noted, is not exactly the flashiest of restaurants. Didn't matter to me, as I really enjoyed seeing actual brick ovens with spits filled with rotating chicken in the line up to the register.Besides the chicken, the sides were good. I was hoping for Yucca fries (apparently another El Pollo Rico in Wheaton has them) but the steak-cut fries were decent. The rice was great, though! It was pre-seasoned and was an awesome side. Furthermore, their soda selection was great- they even had DIET Inca Cola, which I did not know existed until I saw it in line.The chicken itself was awesome. Seasoning was great (if a bit strong in some cases- I could still taste bits of it 15 minutes after leaving the restaurant!) and the chicken was awesome. It was not as juicy as other reviews had suggested, but no matter. Still great.Finally, the price: being able to get awesome half chicken, 2 sides, and a soda for 10 bucks- that's a deal you can't refuse.Highly recommended.
Just like with pho, everybody has their opinions on what the best Peruvian chicken joint is. El Pollo Rico has gotten a lot of publicity in the past few years for, 1) for harboring illegal immigrants and money laundering and 2) for being the Peruvian chicken joint of Anthony Bourdain's choice on a recent Washington DC episode.As a Peruvian chicken afficianado, I believe their chicken is up there in terms of tastiness along with Edy's Chicken & Steak, Super Pollo (my personal favorite), and Super Chicken -- however the overall dining experience has been ruined several times due to the fact that they do not take credit cards (paper trails are easier to follow when you are in the money laundering business) and they don't serve rice with their chicken (hello I'm Asian, I need rice!).Yelpers, I am pleased to say that on a recent trip to El Pollo Rico both of these situations have been remedied so when you go there all you can focus on is sucking off all that delicious meat off the bones (and finding a decent parking spot but that is a story for another day).
The chicken is good. It's also very cheap. For your money, this is a great deal. That being said, I've had better chicken.
It's not even close. El Pollo Rico is the best Peruvian-style chicken joint in the NoVA area. I've been here probably...30+ times, and not once have I been disappointed. The chicken is incredibly flavorful, and importantly, the sauces are rich and not watered down like other places.The place is not perfect, however. Last I checked, you still need cash to pay for your meal. *Edit: Apparently, there is a cash-and-credit line and a just-cash line. I didn't know this!* Thankfully, they've put in an ATM machine in the past couple of years, but paying that fee is a downer when you forget to stop by your bank ahead of time. Also, the parking is horrendous. You'll usually catch someone on their way out of the restaurant, though, so you can take their spot when they leave. Finally, the decor is...well, let's just say it looks like a church retreat dining hall or something. But the chicken is unbeatable. My brother insists there's a place in New York that beats it (hard to believe, but he's reliable), but in the NoVA area, there's no question about it. El Pollo Rico is king.
amazing!!!
I've been here countless times, have brought many new friends, and have nothing but positive things to say. The chicken is always juicy and tender, the french fries are DELICIOUS (I'm convinced it's because the oil they fry them in is used soley for french fries, vs. when you go to other places and they use the same fryer for all fried menu items), and the cole slaw rivals my grandmother's. if you have not been, GO! GO GO! Have I mentioned yet it's ridiculously cheap?If you didn't already know, Pollo Rico was featured on Anthony Bourdain's show, No Reservations, as well. I just wish this place were closer to where I live (in the city).
For the record, I love rotisserie chickens and hole-in-the-walls in less than stellar neighborhoods. But...NOT FAIR ! Why wasn't my chicken juicy and tender like the rest of these yelpers and Bourdain? Why wasn't my chicken EPIC? I came here early Friday night, the line was long, but the staff was quick. I shared a half chicken, french fries and coleslaw with my friend. The french fries were your avg. costco frozen fries and less than average coleslaw (KFC's coleslaw is even better); both were extremely bland. As for the bird, it was just extremely dry, I tried to douse it with their house sauce, but to no avail. Although, not exactly the same taste, I say save yo money for Nando's.
Whether you're rich or poor, black or white, Peruvian or not, it doesn't matter. Whether you're' blue collar or white collar, CEO or ditch digger, it doesn't matter. Whether you're military or civilian, officer or enlisted, it doesn't matter. Everyone, and I mean EVERYONE, eats at Pollo Rico. And, for very good reason. The chicken is out of this world. Very flavorful, very moist and very affordable.
Peruvian chicken... :) :) :)Always packed and there is a legit reason. You can usually get parking because someone is just pulling out. The lot is a pretty decent size, and they have a fair amount of seating inside.Nothing much about the decor...and its pretty much located in a back alley....but Staff is quick, food is great. For about $15 you can get a whole chicken and two sides. Their white rice is magically delicious and flavorful.Be aware though: sometimes they run out of chicken. And sometimes they only accept cash.Delicious.
This is epic chicken. I went here twice so far. I've had Peruvian chicken before in the past a couple of times, but I never liked. It was too dry and it wasn't seasoned enough.But this chicken. Holy god. Juicy. I ate everything, even the weird mushy stuff that usually looks like chicken innerd's. The rice was awesome too. It was enough for my friend to eat as her meal. She in some form failed to tell us that she wasn't able to eat that much chicken; that, and I should carefully read my text messages. So much for a Lunar New Year dinner. The fries. Now, usually fries are hard to get right. If they're too small, they're too salty. And if they're too big, they're too soggy. But these bad boys were on point. Perfect.And the sauces. Green Spicy. Mayo was flavorful. Orally crippling.I'm done here.
Amazing chicken and fries. We were visiting with friends and they insisted we visit this place for its local feel and outstanding chicken. We were not disappointed, this is a must if you are close by and need a authentic, well priced meal.
Amazing chicken. The only sides options are steak fries, slaw, or rice, all of which are pretty mediocre. But the chicken is just that good that I don't really care about the underwhelming sides.
The best pollo in town. I prefer the sides at Caribbean Grill, but it's hard to argue with the economics of chicken, fries and slaw. Walk, don't drive.
I believe this is my first review and happy to start off on a positive note. I had the half white chicken with rice and fries. The chicken was perfectly roasted, crispy on the outside but tender and juicy on the inside. And it had a great spice on the outside as well. The chicken comes with rice, steak fries, or coleslaw, you pick 2. My girlfriend had the quarter chicken with rice and fries as well. She really liked her meal as well and said the rice reminded her of Nicaraguan rice (where her family is from, a good sign since they like their rice in Latin America). She also liked the alfajor that she got for dessert, which is basically a cookie with dulce de leche (caramel) in between. We both tried the Inca Kola and it was good. An interesting taste. Not sure I would get it again but glad I tried it.Not anything fancy by any means, but great food for cheap. Looking forward to taking out of town guests here for a good lunch.
The best Peruvian chicken I've had in the area hands down. The skin has that slight crisp to it coming straight of the rotisserie skewers and the meat holds the juice inside as well. You get sides with the chicken, but I also go with the steak fries. Make sure you get some extra sauces because the yellow sauce is addictive. They are one of the few places around that carry Inca Kola so grab one of these to top off your meal. There generally is a long line but they split into two lines (one on the left and one on the right side) making it go a bit faster. Don't wait too late to get chicken else they'll run out and you'll be disappointed that you won't get your Peruvian chicken fix.
Chicken , fries and coleslaw . . . And maybe a fluorescent Inka cola to wash it all down. That's it, and yes, it is worth all five stars!!Not fancy. No pretense. Just a really authentic Peruvian chicken place doing it's thing well. To be clear, the fries are frozen steak cut and the slaw is a bit too sweet for my taste, but the reason you want to come here is not for the sides. You come here for the pollo! When you are here waiting in line, because, yes . . . . you are likely to be waiting in line for your taste of pollo . . . have a look around!Ultimately, a better indicator then anything I, or my fellow reviewers, could ever offer you here is the fact that there IS usually a line. At lunchtime, there are usually two!So, when you find yourself in line waiting . . . Have a look around at the clientele! You might observe merely a humble cafeteria style dining area full of contented diners munching on chicken bones out of styrofoam containers, but I urge you to take a closer look. The place is usually a virtual UN of faces all harmoniously enjoying the same thing - simple roasted chicken done well at a reasonable price.  Who knew all it took was chicken on a spit?!?!Maybe some of our politicians on the hill should cross the river to Arlington for a half pollo, fries and an Inka.. . . . . ?!?
Not a fan. The two sides they offer, french fries and coleslaw, are high on the yuck value.The fries are stale and greasy tasting. And the grease has a nasty aftertaste, ugh.The coleslaw is bland and runny and generally yucky. On to the chicken. If I had never eaten at Super Pollo I might think this was decent chicken, not great, but not bad. However, when comparing it to the Ambrosia that is Super Pollo, El Pollo Rico's chicken crawls into a dark hole and hides in shame. It is usually dry. Very dry. I don't really enjoy dry chicken. I like my birds to be saucy and full of themselves when I devour them, this chicken is embarrassed and a little bit angry at its treatment. The flavor is okay, perhaps it would be better if the bird were moister, but it really doesn't have that zing I've come to associate with Peruvian chicken. I think maybe they over cook it or something....The building itself is a bit grimy and seedy too. I've never eaten in there, but when I've gone in for takeout I've been very underwhelmed. Overall, if you really want chicken, head over to Super Pollo and treat yourself to some divinely inspired rotisserie chicken that has lots and lots of side dishes to choose from....
This was my first time ever visiting El Pollo Rico. It was the best chicken that I have had in this area that was char-broiled. The staff members were extremely nice and attentive. I did wait for my food but it was well worth it. I even bought a plate to go to give to a family member. The prices are extremely reasonable and I will definitely be back soon!!!!!
I LOVE their chicken w/the green sauce & Inca cola!! It's the best around, hands down..
Not much to say: best rotissery chicken I have ever had. If you are near here, eat here. quarter or half chicke, white or dark meat, you'll be happy. Get some extra sauce and an Inca kola or two. I've tried some of the other Peruvian rotissery around DC, they are mostly good, but this is the best.*please franchise to San Diego!
Delicious Peruvian chicken, crisp steak fries, and always a treat to wash it down with Inca Kola.
This food hits the spot every time. The pollo is tender and juicy. The fries are thick and crispy. Top it off with a cold Inca Kola and your set! This place makes me proud to be 1/2 Peruvian lol
The fab reviews don't lie... this place deserves it. My work buddy introduced me to this place and I've been hooked since. Best pollo a la brasa chicken we have had. Damn, even the white rice is tasty. They charge 25 cents for extra sauce, but hey, it's only a quarter c'mon, not a biggie. You know it's good when there is a long line before they even open on a weekday.If you haven't tried it, what are you waiting for?!
This place has amazing chicken. it's very fresh and full of flavor. Our plate came with great slaw and yummy rice. This place is Peruvian so everything had Latin flavors infused into them, and the music playing made it even more fun for me to enjoy my meal.
El Pollo Rico really is a step above the rest of the multitude of pollo a la brasa places in the area. It is nowhere near as greasy as the other spots I have visited and the fries actually have some flavor. Everything is extremely well priced and you get very large portions. I just wish they had some yuca too...
Great place for Peruvian chicken, though your only choice for sides are fries, rice, or coleslaw (rice and coleslaw are boring here.) Seasoning on the chicken is close to perfect. The line for the parking lot is always packed, and street parking can be a hassle sometimes. When placing your order, the cash-only line is always shorter than the cash-or-credit line.
After all the raves about El Pollo Rico (shout out to Paul D.!), I thought that making a jaunt across the river for a casual Saturday lunch was in order. We were lucky to snag a parking spot in front of the restaurant since parking is pretty limited. I noticed right away that there were two lines for ordering: cash or credit. Luckily we had cash on us so we stood in the significantly smaller line. Ordering was a little difficult 'cause it was hard to hear them but it didn't take long to get our whole chicken, fries, and coleslaw. The fries were ordinary and the slaw reminded me of KFC coleslaw (a bit too much mayo) but the chicken was really good. Why can't my local grocery store douse their rotisserie chickens in spices too? I was nicely surprised that the green sauce was spicy (a lot of times "spicy" doesn't end up being spicy) and it was a nice contrast to the white mayo sauce. I'll leave my review at 4 stars though - just to leave some room for juicier breast meat - but I'm definitely a fan!
And finally a good review. we can't stress enough and endorse every other review on here. The chicken is amazing-moist and flavorful and just down right yummy. Would have got five stars if they had more sides. 'enuff said....
Nothing I can say that hasnt already been said....simple food done amazingly well. The seasonings on the chicken, the sauces, the steak fries...it's all perfection.
first visits here...but last time i checked before i left town...i was dutchess of this place. too bad i'm not nearby to come back to reclaim my title. during my 3 days visit to DC, i ate here twice and take out once. featured on Anthony Bourdain. i came here to check it out. the service was friendly. i told them why i seek out their business and they were happy, that made me happy. their pollo also made me happy. slow roasted over charcoal. chicken was moist, even the breasts were moist. herb flavoring were just perfect, not too salty and not too bland. aromatic. you can even ask for all dark meat when ordering half. i believe all white meat costs a lil more. it's all good. still cheap.try the Inca Soda. $1 each. i'm glad i did. i bought extras to take home. packed them in my luggage because i thought i was gonna check my bags in...in the end, i was late to the airport and had to carry my luggage on board. needless to say, those were thrown out. i told tsa to drink it don't throw it out, it's the good stuff. i was one sad puppy. :(
Very good chicken but limited side dishes. When I go for pollo, I really want some yuca. French fries just don't cut it. So I prefer Super Chicken or Super Pollo or Caribbean Grill.
4.5 StarsMy roommate and I take the metro here about once a week to get some chicken. It is some of the best chicken that we have found in the DC area. Well seasoned, moist, flavorful sauces (I like the green one better, it has a nice kick to it)The only down fail is that the past couple of times that I went there, they were out of chicken! While I understand that the chicken is being cooked fresh daily, it is not worth waiting 30 minutes for it.
Best chicken, great price and the nicest people.
Some of the best pollo around. After having eating here a few times, I managed to make my way to Peru to try some of the peruvian chicken from the homeland.I can say without a doubt, EPR has better chicken than what we were able to find in peru, even if it is a bit more expensive than peru.There may be a long line when you get there, but it moves fast.Make sure you grab a lot of napkins and a hearty appetite.
Probably the best chicken I have ever had. I ordered a quarter (it was more than enough) of white. I also had them include streak fries which are pretty darn good and one white and one green sauce. I also ordered an Inca cola. All that for $6.65! At my brother's suggestion I avoided the coleslaw. He says you see it come out in big plastic buckets and its not all that good. Inca Cola tasted like artificial bubble gum and discarded it after two sips.The chicken skin is perfect. Its just the right flavor. And the meat is nice and juicy. The white sauce is a mayo that is a great compliment to the steak fries. The green sauce was a little too spicy. I would skip it next time. The chicken itself needs no sauce as it is great on its own. If you are in the DC area it is well worth the trip on the Orange Line.
El Pollo Rico is what Crisp and Juicy wishes it could be. And, hey, I loves me some Crisp and Juicy.In my quest to try all major pollo a la brasa joints, I'd say this was definitely the best bird by far. Juicy and flavorful, with perfectly crispy skin (I dig it!). I could eat an entire half by myself. Please don't test me....I'll do it!!!!The sides are limited (chunky steak fries, cole slaw, and white rice), but that just allows the limelight to stay on the chicken. They offer as many desserts as they do sides -- and in the absence of choice sides, my sister and I decided to try them all: the cookies sandwiching dulce de leche (nice, but a bit too sweet for me), a rum cake (OK...a bit dry), and this flakey Napolean-like thingy (eh, it's aight). The service is efficient and kind. The Arlington location has a cash line and cash-n-credit line. Do yourself a favor and bring cash so that you can get your chicken more quickly!I'll be interested in trying the expansion EPR outlets to see if the quality is consistent. But, for my money, best pollo a la brasa I've had in the DMV.
When Anthony Bourdain recommends a place - you just go there. I wasn't as blown away as everyone else seems to be. The chicken was definitely the highlight. Its tender and delicious. Lots of meat. The sauce they give you is good.  I was so dissapointed by the sides though! My fries were squishy and my colslaw was too sweet. The only other option was white rice - who wants plain white rice?? The price is right though. A quarter chicken + 2 sides is about $5. So even if you don't like the sides, the meal didn't cost a fortune.
THE Best spot for Peruvian chicken....Tried other places & I always come back here b/c nothing compares. -$6 gets you a chicken meal w/ 2 sides. Add a chilled Inca Cola and you are in for a treat. -Try the alfahores as well - delicious caramel cookies!Check of Anthony Bourdain's visit to Pollo Rico at: youtube.com/watch?v=6CA2
Awesome chicken! Also, try the Inka Cola with it.
This is suuuuuch a good Peruvian spot! It's very simple..a hole in the wall kind of place...but it's so delicious! And the portions are pretty generous. My boyfriend and I both got chicken with french fries and cole slaw..and he got rice as well. It was soooo good! Simple but delicious. It definitely gets crowded to try and go at times that aren't "dinne" or "lunch" times.
I looove ghetto, hole in the walls and EPR is at the top of my list. Its quick, cheap and YUMMY - win,win. Cash only. If you want sides go somewhere else. If u want really great chicken then EPR is the spot.
What took me so long. Best chicken in the DMV.
Best Peruvian chicken in the DMV. The other places around try to duplicate but fall short. El Pollo Rico is glorious.
I can't believe I have not reviewed EPR yet!One of the top 5 places for gooooooood Peruvian chicken in DMV area.This place is generally crowded despite the fact that it has a lot of seating!Love the marinade that the chicken is cooked in and the chicken is always tender and juicy and succulent!Sides are good too - though plantains tend to go quick!But they have limited number of sides and me personally would like to see chickpeas on the menu!
This place is legit Peru. The wonderfully seasoned rotisserie chicken, the Inca Kola, the chicha morada, the too bright, fluorescent lighting... Went here for the first time last night and the chicken was pretty darn good and pretty darn cheap. Only thing I'd change is the cole slaw. Not sure what they're doing there... I'll be back for sure.
Best Peruvian Chicken in the area. Hands down. Succulent and juicy, with just the right balance of spices. The fries are top notch, not over cooked but with the right combination of crispy and but not overcooked. And while I am not a huge coleslaw fan, this is about as good as it gets. And the best part? It is insanely cheap.
There's a Zagat sticker on the door. That says something. Apparently, rotisserie chicken is some huge trend in this area - I've already had it twice this week from (sardischicken.com) and compared to Sardi's, El Pollo Rico wasn't that great. I understand that they're located miles away from each other, but I just couldn't justify why I'd return to El Pollo Rico.It's like the usual chicken places - you order chicken with some sides and bring it to any table to enjoy. But I don't know if it was this particular night, but the only sides available were rice, cole slaw, steak fries. Wait, what happened to the Yuca or Plantain? Those are the reasons why I love rotisserie chicken.... but El Pollo Rico didn't have it (or it was on some secret menu or something, I dunno).Don't take me wrong, the chicken wasn't bad - a quarter meal was big enough for me (a small asian), but most people around us had a half-chicken. It wasn't as flavored as I had expected, but it was still delicious.--PHOTO: yelp.com/biz_photos/KudJ
I always thought the Wheaton one tasted better. This is much larger when it comes to seating area, but the parking is pretty bad. This is the gold standard when it comes to Peruvian chicken, but the one I got seemed like it was sitting out there for a while. I was expecting more.
A little ghetto but the food is good.
You don't need me to tell you this, but you should go to El Pollo Rico. You should go as soon as possible. How about right now? Now is good.Disregard the reviews that tell you the fries are nothing special. These people are scheming ways to get the fries all to themselves. Do not be afraid, fry-schemers. There are enough fries for us all.Do not think about the wall of chicken.Mix one part green sauce to three parts white sauce. Add more green sauce if you are so inclined. Dip the chicken in this mixture. Dip the fries in this mixture. Do not dip the coleslaw in it, because coleslaw is for victims of the fry-hoarding cabal.You're welcome.
Best mother f'in chicken in the DMV area, hands down! Inexpensive, not greasy, taste good cold or the next day... what more could you want? Yes, they only have 2 sides options! Personally, I do not care for cole slaw and usually order "solo papas". It's never been a problem, and I heart steak fries. I wish they'd open a Burke, VA location!!! Pollo Rico, please DO!!! Burke doesn't have any restaurants, come here PLEASE!!!
The chicken itself gets five stars. I studied abroad in Peru, and this chicken is as good if not better than any I had there. While the fries are good, it's kind of disappointing that rice and what tastes like store brought cole slaw are the only other sides, so I have to take off a little bit. However, the price is a complete bargain for Arlington and the chicken lives up to the hype. 4.5 stars.
As my friends like to call it "change your life chicken." A+ all around. I know this may sound messed up, but they do speak English here, and understand you very well. Its a plus when it comes to ordering your food to your liking. I've been to a few Peruvian chicken places, and I'll say that this place is rather good. Its not at all expensive, and the chicken is tender, and fresh. I suggest that you dine-in, just because this chicken isn't as great if you wait till you get home and its no longer piping hot. I am a huge fan of steak fries...so my bias opinion on them are...GREAT. Sometimes you just can't beat steak fries. When ordering a drink, do not order any soda's in the glass bottles. Personally sodas are not the same, unless they are in cans or plastic...TRUST ME!!!Don't forget to mix the little green and white sauce, its a different kinda feel to the chicken. Dark and White meat were both juicy all the same. Although, I've never really cared much about either with difference in taste.  Try it...it'll "change yo life!"Sidenote: the parking lot is a JOKE. WAY too small for all the traffic this place gets...treat it like a club, and carpool it in...REAL TALK!
Best chicken in town, Peruvian or otherwise. Streak fries are yummy. Wish the Inca Cola was imported, don't like the domestic corn syrup taste as much.
Reminds me of Ensenada. If they only had hot fresh tortillas and gritty mex hot sauce.
Months after my dining experience (it was an experience) I am still sorting out my mixed feelings about this restaurant. I made the mistake of going on a Saturday afternoon - I ended up parking in a very questionable spot it was so jam packed. Turns out the parking was the easy part. The line was out the door! Fortunately, I brought some moolah to this cash only restaurant, and didn't have to stand in the additional ATM line. Twenty minutes later I finally ordered. As soon as our group was ready to gorge on our long awaited chickens, the whole restaurant billowed in smoke! Smoke alarms ensued, however the amount of smoke, and sound of alarm were not enough to overtake any customers! Not a single person in the packed restaurant (we had a member of our group snag seating while we were in line; it was filled to occupancy-probably way past) left their seats to sacrifice their chicken for the fire hazard. Crying babies and hushing mothers only added to the orchestra of chewing to accompany the yelling sounds of the employees and the beeping of the fire alarms. The alarms ceased ten minutes later, and it seemed that a crucial element of our dining experience was lost. The experience was evidently much more memorable than the chicken, which was overly dry and lightly seasoned. Perhaps this is due to the big crowds on a Saturday. Peruvian Chicken in itself is delicious, but I'm accustomed to the succulent juices dripping down my cheek rather than yearning for an additional jugo de coco and dipping into my friend's sauces while they weren't looking. The yuca fries weren't spectacular enough for me to bolster the rating, as others have suggested. There are many better tasting Peruvian Chicken places that have offered less troublesome experiences than this trip to Pollo Rico.
Amazing juicy chicken with great spices!
I look at the pictures on Yelp and my stomach starts growling. This and Ray's Hell burger are the two places we miss the most since leaving Arlington to move out to the LA. We have tried to find as good peruvian chicken out here, but nothing comes remotely close. I can still smell it! It used to be our dinner every sunday night.
Wow, this place surprised me! EPR was recommended by some fellow yelpers as well as a friend that use to live in the area many years ago. I do love me some Peruvian/Mexican food and EPR didn't steer me wrong.I came here for lunch mid-week and it was packed. As you walk in, you need to pick a line at the counter to order your food. The left line is for cash and credit and the right for cash only ... good thing I had cash as the credit line was about 15 people deep. Hint: bring cash! It's a very simple menu ... chicken, chicken, or chicken. You can order a 1/4, 1/2 or a full bird. I ordered the 1/4 rotisserie chicken that came with steak fries, cole slaw and a can of soda ... all for about $6 bucks! From ordering and paying to sitting down with my food it took all of about 30 seconds. This place is fast. As I sat down and looked over my meal I could smell the sweetness of the cole slaw, the fresh herbs on the chicken and the steak fries calling my name ... I dug in! OMG! I have to say, I have tried lots of chicken in my time and this was by far the BEST I think I have eaten. The skin was soft and moist and the chicken tender, juicy and full of flavor from the herbs. It was amazing! The cole slaw was fresh and it had a distinct, sweet, cool flavor to it which complimented the herbs of the chicken and hot steak fries. I also opted for the mild sauce which simply put ... did me in and made this my go to place for fresh chicken.Simply put, EPR is a hidden gem in Arlington and an inexpensive, fast lunch spot where the chicken is amazing and will make you want to come back tomorrow! 4.5 stars for what it is ... convenient, fast, great food and service, inexpensive, no frills joint in the heart of Arlington.
I was first exposed to EPR by my co-workers and I cannot get enough. It is so delicious and super cheap and not to mention filling! The workers there are so fast and are willing to do big orders for take out. Give them a tip deserve it.If you are going to be in the Washington DC area, you must go here! Warning: "It is addictive."There is also a location in Woodbridge, VA. It is tucked away on the right side as you head south. Practicaly empty during lunch hour and that is if you go at 11:00am.
El Pollo Rico is a testament to focusing on a product with great creativity and passion, and delivering it flawlessly and without pretense or expense. I am no expert on the local Peruvian chicken battles, though I know a yummy morsel of goodness when I get it. And this is yummy goodness.There is always a line, nearly out the door, which moves with a deftness. Upon seeing the rotisseries which hug all of the spices into the chicken with love, the wait is confirmed to be worthwhile. I was in awe of the skill and speed by which each portion is cleaved without injury. In part, the plastic ware, plates, and non-descript seating lend to the cafeteria-feel of El Pollo Rico. But it is all part of the charm. Simple service and deep flavors, there are few places which really compare. Also, it is comforting to be in a family-friendly spot. A quarter piece of chicken, fries, and an indulgent inca cola -- yummy yummy. So thankful to have been introduced to this gem in Arlington.
I LOVE THIS PLACE! The chicken is awesome. The service is fast, selections of sides are food and the price is reasonable. Reading other reviews, it seems as if the only sides provided are fries, rice and cole slaw. I may be lucky but when I go, there is always mixed vegetables and plantains being served.
It's. just. SO. GOOD.Get it to go though, not the most pleasant ambiance.
This place is about chicken first and foremost. And it's good chicken. Spicy, smokey, moist, and tender, this place is not to be missed if you happen to be in the Arlington area. It's also a pretty decent bargain.
The chicken here is fantastic but the options for sides is lacking. French fries and slaw...really??? 2.5 stars for the chicken -- it is great!! To the owner - at least get some Yucca!! you can fry it in the same oil..... I think most people would pay for the premium...
Of all the Peruvian chicken joints that are scattered around the DC area (and that have conspired to make this area one of the best spots in the country for such chicken), this one restaurant, based on its reputation and exposure, may very well be the epicenter of it all.Certainly, it is well reviewed; and, on the occasions when I have dined here, it has always been busy and boisterous. Indeed, to eat here is to participate in a DC area rite of passage (like making a requisite stop at Ray's Hell Burger, Ben's Chili Bowl, or standing in line at Georgetown Cupcake).Anyway, on my last visit, the lines weren't too long; and, upon making my way to the counter, it took all of three seconds to place my order. I mean, really, what else is there to get but the chicken (and the predetermined sides of Cole slaw and French fries).Before I proceed, let me just say that I might very well have come on an off-day or, perhaps, on a day when they were breaking in a new hired hand (who in an anxious fit, feeling a bit intimidated by the crush of customers, and a misguided need to impress) misjudged the level of seasoning that he was supposed to use and erred on the side of "more is better." Really, I found the spice rub (which was fairly abundant, especially, on the interior carcass of the chicken) to be overwhelming. I mean, my chicken had been lathered up pretty well with their signature spices; and, rather than enhancing the flavor and experience of eating the chicken (and partnering with the charcoal infused aroma), the chicken simply tasted salty. Furthermore, the chicken was not particularly moist either (not dry but, certainly, not as tender as other Peruvian chicken I've had - and, I've had a lot). In the end, my French fries (big, thick steak cut fries) were the biggest hit. They were fresh, crispy and exuded a satisfying potato flavor.I guess, I will return to reassess at some point; but, for now, I am one of the few dissenting voices when it comes to this esteemed place. Honestly, I wasn't impressed by the chicken; and, it would be silly, really, to come here just for the fries. I think people would look at me and wonder what the hell I was doing.
Excellent Peruvian chicken, fries are also delicious, and you cannot beat the price. I really like their yellow and green sauce (but like Edy's green sauce more).
Best chicken i ever try...everytime i go the line is probably no less then 5 mins waiting but its worth it...!! the juice chicken with steak friends and white rice since i don't like coleslaw..and its close to my house and job..love it !!
Reading another review I just got reminded of the dinner I had here more than a year ago. Till this day my memory is fresh with the delightful flavor of the chicken at this otherwise modest place. Simple fare for fair price (cash only). If this place issued an IPO, I'd be scrambling to purchase some stock because they are minting money. Lines are long and parking can be a problem. Please get your hands dirty with this hot and juicy chicken!
Chicken was good, but not great - too fatty. El Pollo Rico needs to recognize the competition and start adding more sides to its menu. The fries were a dud. Put some delicious yuca or arroz chaufa on the menu. The utensils were apparently the cheapest available - the knife was bending under light pressure when I attempted to cut chicken meat.Better pollo is available for cheaper, with better sides, and better ambiance. I really wanted to dig the legendary EPR, but they need to work hard to get back in the lead, or get ready to get trampled by the competition.
Just another 5 star review to help nudge the scale in the Arlington Peruvian Chicken Wars. I will definitely have a hard time trying to drive back to this place, weird street location I guess. But the chicken was juicy and the steak fries were the surprise of the visit (better texture than yucca, so I didn't miss it as much as the other reviewers). I love a place with a super simple menu and items as cheap as all get-out. Also, the plastic cutlery is a flimsy formality, you'll end up eating with your hands.
Excellent food!!! You can see the chicken cooking when you walk in. We went when there wasn't any lines. The chicken had really good seasoning but had limited sides. They ran out of rice (so i had to get coleslaw... i hate coleslaw). Overall, this is one of the best chicken place i've been. it beats going to KFC The parking is TERRIBLE! But people do go in and out pretty fast. But for a place with that many customers they should get more parking spaces.
The chicken is definitely delicious as only the peruvians can doHowever, I echo others sentiments, give me the mother fuckin YuccaI subtract 2 stars for not acquiescing to popular demandThe masses are clamoring for some Yucca goddamnit!!Make it happen, and i'll reward you with more stars
Best chicken around, no other place in the area compares!!
If you are looking for the best Peruvian chicken around...you will find it here. No frills. Just get your chicken and fries here. I would have given this place 5 stars except for the insanity that is the parking out front. be prepared to have to fight for a parking spot if you go right around the dinner rush.
El Pollo Rico is my favorite spot for Peruvian chicken in the area. To be honest, there are some days when the chicken is not at the quality I expect. Still, even then, it's probably better than most other places. The standard meal is whatever cut of chicken you want and fries. I love sauces, and I have to say the sauces here are very complimentary.The inside is fairly large and clean. The only thing that is a pain is the parking lot, which is tiny. People are usually in and out pretty quick though so spots open up. The price of the food is fair for what you get.
The classic sign of a great local restaurant is a full parking lot, and this one is always jammed. My favorite of the many good Peruvian chicken places in NoVa,
100\% Peruviano chicken. If you want sandwiches or any other specialty meals go to Edy's. People come to Rico for the Chicken!
Cheap and fantastic!
The chicken is very good here. It is moist and the spices are strong. The fries are soggy and nothing special.They have off-street parking.Service is quick. Portions are large. Prices are good.The decor is plain, plastic utensils and so on.But the chicken is very good.
I finally got to visit the Mecca of Peruvian chicken in the DC Metro area this past weekend. What could I possibly add that hasn't already been said in the over 400 reviews this place has already received? Probably nothing but let me blather on anyway.Food: The chicken gets 5 stars. The flavor is OUTSTANDING. Going in, I did not think I was going to be able to taste a difference as all the other Peruvian chicken places I've been to all tend to taste the same. But here I can honestly say their chicken tastes better. I can taste the same seasonings but the flavor is stronger. Someone in my group who has been there many times says that they cook it slower than most places, giving it a stronger flavor. Whatever they do, it's working. I do have to subtract a star for them not having yucca. Only sides available are steak fries, white rice, and cole slaw. THAT'S IT. They literally have more dessert options than they do sides. The sauces are good, especially the yellow sauce that is actually yellow and not just a container of mayo that I suspect some places hand out. The green sauce could have been spicier but as with most places this varies from batch to batch.Location: They moved from their original spot to a little side street across from George Mason's Arlington campus. They have parking on their lot or you can park on the street. This place is popular so at peak times you may find yourself parking around the corner. It's conveniently located within easy walking distance of two Metro stops: Virignia Square and Clarendon.Miscellaneous: Nothing fancy about the interior. In fact, it's pretty much a dump. But there is plenty of seating, tables can be put together easily for big groups, and they encourage you to recycle. Because of the limited menu, service is quick and you get through the line quickly. And speaking of lines, there are two of them: one for cash only and another where you can pay with your credit card.
This place is the mother of all Pollo A La Brasa's in DMV area. I've tried most of the Peruvian Chicken places in the DMV except for Super Pollo, hands down this place has the "IT" factor that all the other joints don't have. Biggest, juiciest, most flavorful chicken out there. Green and yellow sauce is money. The only thing I dislike about this place is they don't sell yuccah fries. The Woodbridge location sells it but nonetheless the steak fries are still pretty good. Please let me know if you find a better Pollo A la Brasa joint better then El Pollo Rico. This place is sooooooo money!
I paid a visit to El Pollo Rico again. The chicken is still extremely delicious.The "green sauce" this time had that KICK I was looking for. I'm not sure if they recently improved their "green sauce" or if the one I had on my last visit was just made less spicier? Either way, it's awesome now!
Delicious juicy chicken with fries and cole slaw, their sauces are so good, I highly recommend this place for any chicken lovers.
Best Peruvian Chicken in Nova
It's decent. Not worth the hype though.
I LOVE THIS CHICKEN! All they serve is chicken and they do it perfectly. You know the food is awesome when there is ALWAYS a crowd. Great chicken for a good price....one word....awesome. The mild sauce with the chicken is perfection.
I have been going to El Pollo Rico since I was a kid...and this place ROCKS my taste buds! This is hands down the BESTest charcoal chicken EVAA! The sauces are delish, and the steak fries are always piping hot...the cole slaw...just heavenly! No need to bring just cash, they take credit cards too! Try it out and you'll be hooked for years, just like I have!
You know you're in for something good when you walk (as I did) or drive into the parking lot and are engulfed by rich, fragrant charcoal smoke that smells umistakeably like delicious roasting chicken.The chicken is excellent. The meat is perfectly spiced, skin-on, as it should be. The dark meat is succulent and tender, the white meat equally so if not quite as flavorful (as would be expected). Based on the meat alone the rating would be a five.Where the restaurant falls short are the accoutrements. The steak fries, while decent, are nothing special. The coleslaw is meh. I was really hoping for fried yucca, but was disappointed. The sauces are just ok.The plastic silverware that came with the meal was so cheap and thin that the tines of the fork literally melted upon contact with the hot chicken. I don't mean to be a whiner, but come on.But all that taken into account, the chicken is still amazing, and those working and living nearby are lucky to have a spot to get great food for very reasonable prices. I hope I'll be back again soon.
My foray in Peruvian food started in N Virginia. Although I am still half convinced that whilst drunk, I can understand Spanish but make absolutely no pretense that also whilst drunk there would be no way I could ever re-create the cooking styles they do here to prepare a perfect bird.The decor here is plain but the crowds speak to why there are lines of people here each day. I guess it did not help that Anthony Bourdain made an appearance here as well.Definitely a must stop.
The chicken is tasty and the fries and rice are fine, but I really don't like having dinner without any vegetables and there are no vegetables on their menu. What they do have is tasty, but it's the smallest menu I've ever seen.
Never had Peruvian chicken until EPR. This is a thriving niche, no frills resto that was featured by Bourdain. It's probably the best rotisserie chicken EVER. It is amazingly flavorful with spices, tender & the skin, oh the skin, has a lovely crunch. I didn't like the sides, chose the steak fries, they were soggy, upon more research, found out they are frozen and the coleslaw a mayo lover's dream. Sauces: mayo-mustard, great w/the bird, but the spicy cilantro lime really kicked me in the butt, too spicy for my palate. Definitely take to-go, whole chicken & two sides for under $16 and roll down your windows, the smell will permeate your car for DAYS.
I've been to a handful of Peruvian chicken spots and El Pollo Rico blows them all out of the water. I wish they had yuca, but the fries are so delicious that it doesn't really matter.
Solid 4 star joint. A quarter chicken is enough for an average appetite, though you'll have to stretch with just two sauces (get one mayo and one green, or better yet, two of each). The steak fries are good, and the all-white slaw is even better. Try the antifreeze-colored Inca Kola, which tastes to me like honeysuckle or elderflower. Cash only.
Its great to eat at chicken place that takes pride in their spices and marinades. The chicken is mouth watering delectable! and they have Inca Cola!!!
This place is okay. But Super Pollo is so much better that I'll never come back, even though Pollo Rico is more convenient. El Pollo Rico is a warehouse with cheap tables and chairs, with a cafeteria line in one corner. The menu is tiny -- just chicken with cole slaw or fries, and a fridge case full of soda. The end. (Compared to Super Pollo and its list of 10 sides, including key things like plantains and yuca, and daily specials.)But most importantly, the chicken is DRY and BLAND compared to Super Pollo. The sauce is like a poor imitation of Super Pollo. I sound like a broken record.This is NOT the best chicken around, parking is impossible, and the atmosphere is cafeteria/warehouse style. I don't see the appeal.
Pollo a la brasa is the equivalent to American hot dogs and apple pies. It is a staple in Peruvian households and restaurants.After hearing much hype about this joint, I decided to make a weeknight trip to buy dinner @ El Pollo Rico and skip washing the dishes.The service was super quick and the employees were friendly and helpful. The parking was free and I always appreciate that!I ordered the following:a whole chicken (dark & white meat)2 sides of steak fries1 side of white rice2 alfajores 2 cans of Inka KolaMy husband and I ate the following:e-very-thing (we did have leftovers for next day's lunch)The spices on the chicken were spot-on. They were hearty and made for a nice textures of flavors. They gave off an amazing and saliva-inducing auroma. Yum. The chicken was well-coooked. Well-executed pollo a la brasa always cooks the chicken through & through - there are no red portions near the bone.The steak fries were good - not amazing - just your standard fried fare.The white rice was tasty and moist. I have a feeling they use the same tricks my grandmothe uses - oil & garlic powder.The green picante / hot pepper sauce was delish and the white, creamy sauce was good as well. I just wish they gave you more.The alfajores were moist and not too sweet. They had a tinge of saltiness and reminded me of home.The Inka Kola is a GREAT compliment to the spices of many Peruvian dishes including pollo a la brasa. It's like eating McDees with coke.We plan to come back. Again & again.
Just to confirm what you could already discern from all the other commenters: El Pollo Rico is fantastic. I wasn't there at peak hours (it was around 4 p.m. on a Saturday), so I can't say much about the dinner rush, but the service was astonishingly fast. I split half a chicken with a friend, (which cost about $4 apiece), then we each got a drink and fries. It came out to under $7/person for all that, it was filling, and it was damn good. Perfectly cooked chicken -- tender, not dry -- and the sauces (both the spicy and mild) are a perfect addition to the meat and to the fries. El Pollo Rico is slightly off the beaten path, between the Virginia Square and Clarendon metro stops, but it was undoubtedly worth the trip.
I'm sorry El Pollo Rico lovers but in the battle between EPR and Super Chicken, my vote is for SC....We were fortunate to get a whole chicken right out of the roaster. It was delicious, moist, and tender but didn't seem to have packed a lot of flavor that SC did. A limited amount of sides but their fries were crisp on the outside, potatoey on the inside. Tres Leches cake was bomb, prices were cheaper, and ample seating inside. Service was friendly compared to SC where you barely get an audible hello.
Excellent !!! For $6.00 I can get 1/4 chicken (white) steak fries and cole slaw and 2 extra sauces. Great price and it is finger licking good chicken, i get it almost 3 times a week after the gym makes a great dinner.
El Pollo Rico gets five stars for three simple reasons: great tasting food, unbelievable prices, and truly fast service.The food is fantastic. The chicken is delicious, well-cooked, and tender. The steak fries are awesome, and the dipping sauces are the perfect topping for them. The cole slaw is also great. The prices are unbelievable. A quarter chicken and two sides (a HEAP of food) for under ten dollars? It's unbelievable. I can't believe how cheap this place is, and I can't believe how good the food is at the price.The service is unbelievably fast. I can't believe how fast things come out, even when there's a tremendous line. You can really get your food and get out of there in 10-15 minutes tops if you're in a hurry for lunch.In short, I love this place. It's great. (Oh, and just a quick word of warning - the Inca Kola is unbelievably sweet - be careful.)
Follow my instruction to order here: half chicken (ask them whether it's possible for you to have all thighs or the brown meat. It was much tastier than the white meat or breast, since they can take order for all white meat for additional bucks, so why not all brown meat?). double rice as sides (so they have cole slaw, fries, and rice. Order the rice for the 2 sides you can choose for your half chicken order. Why? Since that's their best side. The rice is really good and tasty, I really wondered what they put on it, some coke? But I will order 2 sides of rice and more of it if I ever come back here again). Green sauce (don't bother with the white sauce since it was killing the flavor of the chicken itself in my opinion. The chicken itself was already tasty, therefore I saw no point of adding more concoction to kill the taste. The green sauce on the other hand just added some spices on the chicken which was really good for me). If I lived around this area, I would definitely come back for more and more of this chicken. Why? It's cheap! It's a high quality food, very tasty, very very legit friendly and witty staff, what more could you ask for?
In comic book guy's voice: Best Peruvian style rotisserie chicken...ever! I've been going here for a loooooooong time and no one will regret coming here!
Best chicken in the DC area. The chicken is always crispy and is addictive. There is a reason that a line can often be found and that those in line will continue to wait...because it is damn good chicken.
My favorite chicken place in the world. What more superlatives can I possibly write about their chicken that you haven't seen here already? When I'm back in the DC area, this is a must stop. Maybe I'll go to a museum. Maybe I'll walk by the White House. Maybe I'll go to Tyson's. I do know that I'll stop here. It's so flavorful that you immediately realize wow, this is unique. Great combo with the fries and condiments. Is it lime zest? I don't know, but it's great with the yellow mayo swirled together.The only problem you'll have is that once you eat here, you'll be upset that you haven't been spending at least once a week here for the past 10 years and you'll also be upset with the person who brought you here in that they didn't bring you here before. Yes, they were selfish, but get over it. You're here now.I now live many miles away, but I have a recent 12 megapixel picture of my 1/2 eaten chicken plate that I zoom into and it makes me smile. I wanted to take a picture before I started devouring the chicken, but hey.... stuff happens. An excuse to come back.
I am a chicken lover. I don't think I could ever give up chicken for anything, but this place makes me ADDICTED. I have been going to El Pollo Rico for some time now, and I have to say I crave this chicken at least once a week (but probably eat it more than that!). The combination of spices put into El Pollo Rico's chicken are absolutely some of the best way to marinade, spice, and cook chicken -- Peruvians have it down perfectly. I have had a lot of Italian-home cooked chicken and this restaurant always makes me feel like it's home cooked. They will offer you your choice of amazing potato wedge-cut fries, rice, or coleslaw as a side. But the real treat is in the sauces. One green hot and one yellow mild mixed together makes a medium sauce that gets me scraping my fries on the sides of the plastic cup to get out every last ounce of flavor.Finally, as if all that wasn't enough, the price is the best I've seen for this quality of food. Between $5-10 (cash only), and you can literally be eating in seconds or out the door. (Without a line, I have been in and out in about 1 minute.)
I'm licking my fingers as I write this. The pollo is so tender melts in your mouth like butter. I stopped by here for lunch. The place was packed but it only took me a few minutes to get to the register and recieve my pollo. I don't know if I would rate this the best place for Peruvian chicken, but it is certainly pretty damn good. I had the quarter of chicken with fries and cold slaw and a couple of hot jalepeno puree things on the side. Washed it down with aqua de coco(coconut juice). My total was 7 dineros and some change. It was well worth the drive (Drove from L'enfant plaza). Downside for me eating at latin/hispanic places: they always try and speak to me in Spanish! Don't they know what country this is?? Haha! I guess it doesn't matter when your chicken is that good.
Although this was my first time trying Peruvian chicken, I have to say, I fell in love with this place. The chicken was extremely moist and cooked to near perfection. Their ambroisal, spice chicken is a must try! The skin of the chicken was crisp with a hint of seasoning, very flavorful. They do a good job on marinating the chicken. The meat inside was tender and lean. I usually prefer dark meat when it comes to chicken, but the white meat here was astoundingly better. The chicken also came with delectable sides of cole slaw and steak fries or spanish rice. Just order all of them! Everything here was fresh, you could see the chicken being grilled in the rotisserie.This is a whole-in-the wall carryout/dine in place, so don't be surprised.
I've tried 30+ broiled chicken places in DC, and this is the best. I once saw a line out the door at 2:30pm. That says enough, in my opinion. And even with the long line, they moved you through quickly.This is quite simply a DC treasure. The chicken is very juicy and crispy and it's a few notches better than the close competitors (El Pollo Sabroso and Crisp and Juicy, for example), but I think the key factor that boosts El Pollo Rico is the sauce and the fries.The yellow sauce is fantastic. It's thick and sweet. Ever had that runny yellow sauce with your chicken that tastes like it came straight out of a Kraft salad dressing bottle? It seems like dozens of places offer it that crap. This is much better.Ordering tip: Get a half chicken with just fries. Add an extra yellow sauce (it comes with one yellow and one green). This will allow you to dip nearly every fry and piece of chicken into the sauce. Your stomach will explode following the consumption of this meal, but that's ok. Take a nap and do it again later.
We needed a cheap dinner and did a good ol' yelp search. And found this awesome place. The chicken is AMAZING. go.eat.indulge. An be a glutten and get a half chicken. Be a man.
Visit Date: 08.08.2010I had never tasted Peruvian chicken before, yet this was some of the best chicken I've ever had. I had the half chicken plate that was accompanied by coleslaw and steak fries. The seasoning on the skin was flavorful and the chicken meat was tender. The steak cut fries were nice and crisp. I didn't care much for the coleslaw since I usually don't eat that stuff in general, as it is usually made with a lot of dressing and sauce, the one here was no exception. I also had the Inca Kola for the first time, which tasted like bubblegum soda.
Love this place, the chicken is something that you will crave. Great seasoning and tender chicken with thick cut fries and slaw. Worth the wait in line if you show up during busy hours.
El Pollo Rico makes me proud to be an American. Pay no mind to those who whine about irrelevant things like ambiance and sides. The chicken is the best and the price is cheap. Lock it up.
Super Pollo has more options but people still love this place. Chicken is good but I gotta say steak fries and cole slaw are not food items I wanna make habits in my diet. For that, you get 3 stars.
It was good...Maybe I've been spoiled by Super Pollo, but the lack of chickpeas and other tasty sides and being stuck with fries (meh) and Cole Slaw (Yuck) just didn't make up for the fact that the chicken is really good.
When a restaurant only has one item on their menu, has no website, yet constantly has lines stretching out the door, you know it has to be good. Such is the case with El Pollo Rico. We first heard about El Pollo Rico on an episode of Anthony Bourdain's No Reservations. After trying it out, we were hooked. El Pollo Rico is in our regular rotation of our take-out dinners, and since we needed a quick meal tonight, El Pollo Rico it was! For $8, you get a delicious meal for two: one quarter of juicy, tender, roasted chicken, marinated in a mystery of pure goodness, fries (a nice mix of big soft soggy ones and little crispy ones), and delicious homemade coleslaw. The meal is satisfying to both our stomachs and our wallets. It can't be beat.
Total dive with a simple menu but the food is great, as long as you like chicken, fries, and rice. Best Peruvian chicken in the area. Gotta have an open mind about the atmosphere for your first visit. Also, don't be put off by the long lines, they are very quick to process orders. Cash only but they have an atm in the store.
Repeat: Best Peruvian chicken in the DC area.
dude.yum.fast.greasy.yum.
The first Spanish I ever learned growing up in Southern California was "crazy chicken" because of the chain El Pollo Loco. My family loved El Pollo Loco, and now living here, I am glad I found it's even tastier cousin Rico. The chicken here is consistently well seasoned and moist. The fries are crisp and the coleslaw is sweet like KFC, which is a good thing in my mind (another place I ate growing up; did I mention that my family loves chicken?) Sometimes I wish they did have other sides like plaintains or other sauces like Chicken on the Run in Bethesda, but I can't fault them for sticking to a formula and doing it well. The place is always full, but forunately the line moves fast.Probably a 4.5 but rounding up because it's a great deal and if it's good enough for Anthony Bourdain, it's good enough for me.
I come here about 2-3 times a month. If you can handle the mad lunch rush, go for it. I have come out for an early dinner a few times and have caught them right as they pull out the dinner chickens, and whoa nelly, its unlike any other chicken I have had. Great price and simple ingredients make for a great meal. I havent had some other highly rated Peruvian chicken joints in a while, so I cant say hands down this is the best, but it has to be one of the best in the DC area.
Love, love, love this place. The chicken is so delicious and the fries, oh the fries, are just the best in this whole city in my humble opinion. Mind you - I like British style chips which might explain why I love the fries. My husband prefers Crisp and Juicy and we have to fight over whose chicken we're going to go eat.
The chicken is very good -- especially like the level of crisp attained with the skin -- and also very flavorful, moist and tender. The fries leave a lot to be desired. The cole slaw is good. Sauces -- I like the green jalapeno sauce, but was not as enamored with the mayo/mustard sauce. Prices were very reasonable. I will probably return, though I prefer Super Pollo and Crisp and Juicy.

Te best Peruvian rotisserie chicken ever.
How do they cook chicken like this?? If u think u or ur mom cooks the best chicken, try here! Not romantic place but great chicken and cheap.
Come on, does this really need a review?Okay here we go...chicken cooked over a fire with seasoning, creamy coleslaw, and crisp yucca. The only next step is to swallow the drool, get you some chicken, click 4-5 stars, and go on about your day
The best peruvian chicken I've eaten anywhere. No credit cards...bring cash. Don't forget the Inca Cola.
This is pretty good Peruvian chicken. It literally slides off the bone. Cole slaw is legit and fries are thick :) Consider the rice if you don't like either of the 2 options available. Meal comes with 2 sides (or 4 if you get the whole chicken). One last recommendation is to get an Inca Kola. It's a staple Peruvian soda that tastes great and for me is a real treat since it's hard to find. It's basically served only in restaurants that sell Peruvian, Ecuadorian, or some times Cuban food. Try it!
You know this was just unimpressive. I am a Mexican and I do enjoy Peruvian food and understand flavor differences. But the chicken marinade just wasn't there .. Bland. I am used to Mexican barbecued flavors, the many regional variations that explode on your tongue ... This just doesn't show up
One of my favorite all time spots. Line gets long and goes fast. First place that I've been to and actually waited in line with all the other nuts when they sold out of chicken. That's how good the chicken is!!! Many folks don't talk about it much but the rum cake that sits in the glass dish on the counter is VERY good too!! Gave it 4 stars because since my last visit I think they changed the coleslaw. It taste hard now!!!
I saw this place on No Reservations and I figured it'd be better or something than the 6 or 7 peruvian chicken joints in the admo/ch/mt pleasant area. I wouldn't say it was better but it certainly was different. The chicken was a lot more citrus/peppery and instead of yucca they only had slightly soggy steak fries. The green spicy sauce is a little less hot than what I'm used to and the white sauce is a little more thick and mayoey.I personally like the stuff in my neighborhood more but it might just be the joy of familiarity. It's still a great deal and still worth trying but I prefer El Pollo granjero on Columbia Rd.
Generally speaking, chicken sucks. No seriously, ever wonder why people say they like it because it tastes like whatever you cook it in? It's because they don't enjoy eating real animals and since chicken doesn't taste like anything, it picks up the flavor of whatever glop you drown it in.So here's the thing, places like Pollo Rico make me want to listen to the Chik-Fil-A cows and Eat Mor Chikin. It's tender, juicy, flavorful and everything you'd want in a life form below you on the food chain. If the sides weren't weak, I would give it 5 stars.
Hard to beat when two adults can eat for less than $15, and with an excellent meal to boot. No need on mentioning the chicken, it's definitely some of, if not, the best in the area. This was one of the first and is still holding strong. I wish they had yuca to offer instead of regular fries, however, they are good style steak fries.
Hello All,Yes, I'm a picky eater. So after reading some of the comments as this Chicken was good, I decided to give it a try.Not much parking, had to wait a lil' while. The restaurant was full, and my mom always said, "if you see a lot of people, that tells you it's good"So I ordered the half chicken with french fries.... Got to admit, yes, the chicken is good with the green sauce they give (did try this white sauce they give). I really wish I had a 'tortilla' lol, but it was all good. The Chicken wasn't dry or over cooked. I love french fries and yes they were good too.Yes, I've had better Chicken back in Cali, but I will return to this location every time I'm in the area.Thanks Yelpers, all because of your reviews.(You know, I only wished the employees wore a hair net or at least comb their hair, lol....);0)
If you want juicy, tender, and uber delicious chicken then look no more! This chicken is so tender that i barely had to touch it to get it off of the bone. The chicken is so juicy and flavorful that it does not even need sauce. You should only go here if you are craving or seeking CHICKEN (for a couple of reasons...) One is because chicken is the only meat served and the other is because if you are going here it's not for the side dishes, it's for the CHICKEN! There is usually a line, but it is worth it and the wait is short. The people that work there are super friendly, and know what they are doing. There is quite a bit of seating inside, but it can be hard to find a parking space because this place is so popular. I highly recommend this place to anyone wanting fabulous chicken.
The chicken: 5 starsRestaurant: 4 stars (I like these kind of places, wait in line to order and get your food, kind of a dive)Sides: 1 star; fries were ok, cole slaw was just a big blob of mayonnaise, and rice looked bland and mediocre.I'll go back for the chicken, but not much else. If the sides were better, I'd go more often.
Wow. Peruvian chicken is amazing. Who knew that plain rotisserie chicken could taste this good? The first time I had rotisserie was from Shoppers (the grocery store) and I decided I did not like rotisserie. Then, my friend introduced me to Peruvian chicken and in particular, El Pollo Rico. Muy sabroso! Ask for extra yellow sauce and mix the green chile sauce into the yellow sauce for an explosion in your mouth.Also, they started offering rice now, not anything special - stick with the fries.Another good Peruvian chicken place (that has a bit more variety with different dishes) is Super Chicken.
Continues to be the best Peruvian chicken I have ever had. I go here almost once a week and have never been disappointed, consistently wonderful!
I have very little to add to the other 350+ reviews on this page, but I nevertheless feel obligated to weigh in on one of my favorite places in Arlington. Nothing but roasted Peruvian chicken here, but it is juicy and delicious, with crispy, seasoned skin, and I can't get enough of it; a quarter chicken, along with fries and slaw, is one of the most comforting lunches I can imagine. Besides, it's kind of fun to order food from a guy wielding a cleaver. I like the atmosphere as well; the whole place is a little run down, but always filled with happy people from all walks of life. Good chicken is the great equalizer, I guess. If you are in the area and you haven't been here, I'm confused by you. The parking does suck, but circle the block a few times and you should be able to find something.
great prices. great chicken. great sides. It's a hole in the wall peruvian chicken hot spot in arlington. lines are long. Chicken combos are dirt cheap. menu selection is limited but they're good at what they offer. only drawback. they charge a lot for sauces. i think that's where they make the $$
Not bad, but not as good as Super Pollo, which is just down the street. Both places season their chicken the same way, but Super Pollo is never as crowded, let's you pay with a credit card, and has a wide variety of side dishes. Pollo Rico only lets you choose between cole slaw, fries and plain white rice. Super Pollo, on the other hand, gives the option of chick peas, lentils, yuca fries, french fries, steamed veggies, mash potatoes, cole slaw, fried rice, white rice, and an onion/cucumber salad. Beat that.
Saw this place on No Reservations with Anthony Bourdain, so I wanted to try it. Menu is very minimal...1/4, 1/2, or whole chicken (with some white/dark meat variations) and a choice of ~4 sides. The seasoning on the chicken is pretty damn good and the chicken in juicy as can be. I have had better green sauces for Peruvian chicken, but you come here for the rub anyways. The place looks like a warehouse form the outside so don't be dismayed by lack of decor.
I grew up eating at this place - old location a few blocks away. And even though I live further away I will still drive to Arlington for this. The absolute best Peruvian chicken ever!!!
I'd heard the hype and wanted to give it a go. It just didn't do much for me. Not that it wasn't worth the money... For the price it wasn't bad but I just wasn't wowed by the unimpressive flavor of the chicken. And the rice was kind of cold. Meh...
I really shouldn't have to write that they have good chicken here, it is the only item on the menu and there is always a line. The line moves very fast though because there really isn't much to say - you can get either a 1/4, 1/2, or whole chicken. They will ask if you want fries and cole slaw with the chicken. I am surprised by how many times people say no - I guess that is saying a lot about the chicken and a lot about the sides. I think the sides are fine. Nothing amazing.It is really the chicken that shines here. Not sure if they inject it with fairy dust or crack, but I always want another piece when I am sadly finished with the first. I am basically shocked that someone said this place is expensive. It's less than $4 for a 1/4 chicken, fries, and cole slaw, which equals a heaping plate of food and a happy girl.
Good chicken? I had better. This place doesn't offer yuca or any variety of sides.Pretty expensive for what you get. No salads either. Very disappointed. Don't know what all the hype is about. The skin wasn't even crispy. Infact, it was very fatty and the quality of the chicken wasn't great either.So let's summarize:Price :(Variety :(Chicken quality :(Seating :)
Two words: Freaking delicious. I don't know if there are secret ingredients or if it's the way or length of time they roast these suckers, but this chicken is soooooo good. The rice and fries are good, too, as are the dipping sauces that come with.
Hands the best Peruvian chicken you can ever eat.
The best deal and best tasting roasted chicken. The sauce they have for the fries is soo good. If you feel like a treat get an alfajore.
I've been going to El Pollo Rico for the last 20 years and I will continue to go there til I die. Their chicken is DELICIOUS and I love that they are always consistent everytime I go. They are reasonably priced too. I recommend this restaurant to everyone.
grateful to have been brought here by a friend who lives in the vicinity, i thought i might as well enjoy the experience. i ordered half a broiled chicken that was cooked to perfection. it tasted like it was marinated overnight in special herbs and other concoctions. it actually reminds me of some meals i've had in Latino food places in Jackson Heights, Queens in NY. it was certainly a memorable brunch we had during that particularly cold and windy day in that part of Arlington, Virginia (just across DC).
simple and good
im not that impressed, its good chicken i guess, but 9 bucks for a half chicken and you have to get sides(they wont reduce the price) go for the experience, but its not mindblowing as the other posters would claim, also i have a friend from peru who told this place was 'ok but not great' , i can confirm that
I think I've figured out the secret ingredients! The chicken is seasoned with cumin and pure heroin. How else could it be this addictive?!?Best. Chicken. Ever.
Chicken, fries, rice, and coleslaw. That's pretty much the entire menu, and it is all excellent. I made a pilgrimage here just for the chicken and it was truly memorable.If only they gave even half a thought to the decor. The place feels like a bus station.
You have to admire a place that does one thing and does it better than anyone else. This place does chicken and it's amazing.I went here with a few friends on a Wednesday night around 7 PM. There was literally already a line outside the front door of this place. It took probably 20 minutes to get up to the counter but the wait was oh-so-worth-it.The menu is awesome. There's chicken. And that's about it. Yeah you can some sides like fries or coleslaw and order a drink but that's pretty much it. I got the half chicken (white and dark) with fries and slaw.The chicken... so good. Perfectly juicy, amazing seasoning... it makes my mouth water just thinking about it while writing this review. The coleslaw was really good too, and I am usually not a coleslaw fan. Seriously, this stuff is great and if you don't think so, you need your head examined.Fortunately there is a quite a bit of seating available here because the place gets packed. Don't wait too late because this place does sell out from time to time.
The daily lines from the register to the front door tell the tail. Perfect balance of crispy skin and juicy charcoal rotisserie chicken. The special blend of spices and seasoning that is used pure magic that turns chickens into gold. Served with run if the mill thick-cut fries, coleslaw, and two side sauces (mayo-based & hot pepper), the chicken is the star of the show!Simple fact; El Pollo Rico is an Arlington institution and should be required dining.
As befitting a classic Arlington landmark of this institute's quality and prestige, the following review must be sung to the tune of "Love and Marriage" by the late, great, Mr. Frank Sinatra: *cough*... ahem... *bumble bee... bumble bee bumblebee bumblebeeeeeeee* Ok... Peruvian and chicken, Peruvian and Chicken, go together like a horse and carriage. This! I tell you, brother... you can't have one without the oooooother.. Pollo Rico, Pollo Rico.. it's an institute you can't disparage... ask the local El-Salvadorian immigrant or construction worker.. and they will say it's awful tasty!! Try.... try.... try and replace them... it's an illusion... Try... try... try... and you will only come..... to this conclusion...Pollo Rico, Pollo Rico... makes chicken like you can't disparage! You were told by this yelper.... you can't have one... ...you can't have none.You can't have one without the ooooooooooooooooo-ther!--End Scene-- --curtain--
This is the best Peruvian chicken I've ever had in my life. PERIOD.
I've been eating Peruvian food for the better part of the last 15 years, but the pollo a la brasa here is head and shoulders above the rest. There's something about the DC area for having some of the best Pollo a la brasa in the country, I'm not sure what it is. Every neighborhood Peruvian chicken spot has something different about their rub that makes it unique for that area, and I think that El Pollo Rico is really superior to the rest. I'll first get started by saying this is not a Peruvian restaurant in the sense that you can get lomo saltado, mariscos saltado, etc. like at a Mi Lindo Peru in San Francisco. They do one thing, and one thing only... Peruvian style Rotisserie chicken. They don't have the sides that other places like Crisp and Juicy have - beans and rice, plantanas, YUCA - but their chicken is that amazing. If you do one thing only, it makes sense that their chicken is that goddamn good.Minor gripes would be parking is not as readily available as you'd want for a place so popular, and you have to make sure to bring cash (not that you need that much) because they don't accept credit cards. Other than that, bring friends, an appetite, order some whole chickens and Inca Kolas to start one of the best food comas you could ask for midday on a weekend!
Takes cash only, LONG LINES POLICE IN the LONG LINE, CHICKEN is FINGER SUCKING GOOD. WOO CHILD. BEST Pervian CHICKEN I'VE ever tasted. under $5 LOVE IT......yes it is RICO....Ok here is how the Peru Chicken joints rate to date.1. El Pollo Rico flavor is intense, cash only.. YES, YES & YES would TRAVEL LONG DISTANCE to GET..2. Caribbean Grill succlent juicy chicken more menu offerings fresh veggies flavor is just a wee bit less intense than El Pollo Rico.. YES & YES3. Super Pollo Nice flavor more menu offerings of sides.. YES & YES4. Silvestre Chicken. offers shrimp tacos; ok flavor. 5. Don Pollo succlent chicken faint flavor Side dishes are good. Don't like yucca but these are the best I have had hands down. I would go again if in the area.6. Chicken on the Run same menu as Don Pollo no flavor yucca and potato salad sides were good. Not Impressed7. El Pollo Sabraso.. got the mixed grill plate(chix, steak, sausage) food was flavorful cooked to order, customer service is nice.8 . The Havana Cafe..the Black BEANS are the BOMB, customer service is wonderful. Yes I will return.OK the verdict is El Pollo Rico is #1 CHICKEN in flavor while Caribbean Grill and Super Pollo is 2nd in chicken and Side dishes. and Havana Cafe is the winner for their Black Beans so full of flavor.
When it comes to Peruvian chicken, EPR is the king. I have tried quite a few of them, but EPR is the one I keep coming back to. While the choice of sides may leave something to be desired, the reason to go is the chicken. The chicken is consistently flavorful and tender, and the green sauce is amazing - spicy and delicious. The service is also great. EPR runs a tight ship. I went to Super Pollo once, and it seemed like a mess.
We used to live about 4 blocks from this place and it was a frequently visited joint. There's nothing spectacular going on here, just two things done very well. Chicken and fries. You like chicken? They have chicken. You like fries? They have fries. You like both of these things together with green or yellow sauce? Welcome to Heaven. I loved this place. So much that I still think about it here on the other side of the country. Cheap, fast, and delicious. Why do fast food chains still exist in America when we have stuff like this? Don't answer that, I already know the reason. Reason has nothing to do with it.You will hear people say or write "Peruvian style" which may give you pause if you have no idea what they're talking about. This is basically African and Native American style open flame barbecue. In other words, rotisserie chicken with herbs and spices common to South America. The taste will be very familiar to you, so don't be scared.Plus, cops eat here. Anywhere you see cops eating you know has to have something going for it. Cops typically take pride in the communities they police and like to eat good food close to good people. If you see a cop dining with other cops in any particular joint, odds are there's something on the menu there that's special. Since there's basically one thing on the menu at The Rich Chicken, the math becomes very easy.Best breasts I've ever seen on a chick.
They do cook a delicious bird. The seasonings and sauces are right on. The only reason I couldn't give it 5 stars is because they don't serve Yuka! That's like a Mexican place not serving Jalapeos.
This place introduced me to the wonder of Peruvian style chicken. I used to eat here once a week. It's still quite good, as evidenced by the completely jammed parking lot, but the quality has slipped bit. Rather than tasting like they're straight off the rotisserie, dinners now seem to have been pulled out from under a heat lamp. As much as I hate to do this to an old friend, I must say that Super Pollo has eclipsed EPR as the best chicken joint in Arlington.
This place makes some absolutely delicious chicken. The chicken alone is worth 5 stars in my opinion. It was cooked perfectly it was literally almost a step too close to dry though. It was hovering right around that point, as if the owners like to play with fire (generated from coals). The cumin and coriander combo is heavenley, I wanted to like the fat and loved eating the skin for the flavor alone. The fries and the slaw were meh, the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of five and the other downside is the small sauces which are definitely not large enough nor enough for a quarter much less half a chicken. Notheless the chicken is heavenly and a must
The long lines and full dining room should be indication; Not sure what the gripe is from the "one star" ratings, patrons must have had an unusual experience...I've been going to El Pollo Rico since the early 90's when they used to be a one burner shop across from the Burger Trolly on 10th st. They have remained consistent and continue to serve the best Peruvian Chicken north of Peru; BTW - I am Peruvian and have eaten plenty of rotisserie chicken to know this is the est in the area.If there is one thing missing it's Yuca...Really looking forward to my local Pollo Rico opening in Woodbridge...
I would normally label a place like this a best-kept secret. However, it must not be a secret since hundreds of Yelpers have rated it very highly.I initially noticed the place as I walked down a side street near the Virginia Square Metro station. It was a Sunday afternoon around 2 pm and I noticed a packed parking lot in front of a small strip mall and a stream of people going in and out of the place. After settling into my hotel, I checked Yelp and saw that an unusually high number of Yelpers had rated the place, it had an average rating of more than four stars and it was cheap. Four stars and one dollar sign--my kind of place! I walked over to check it out.I hesitate to label it fast food as I would probably never give a normal fast food joint more than half a star. However it is fast, probably out of necessity, as I bet it is absolutely packed with a line out the door during busy times. Even at 3 pm on a Sunday afternoon there was a steady stream of customers coming through, though I didn't have to wait long until I was at the counter. A team of people are lined up ready to take your order. I ordered a quarter chicken with cole slaw and an Inca Cola, paid six bucks, and in about three seconds my meal was handed to me. The menu: Chicken. Actually, to be specific, it's Peruvian rotisserie chicken: Quarter, half, or whole. Two options for sides: Cole slaw or fries. A few choices of canned drinks. That's it. Let me tell you that there is no reason they need anything else on the menu. WOW! Perfect, moist, flavorful chicken. I can't think of a better chicken other than maybe the time I paid three bucks for a whole rotisserie chicken from a street vendor in Paraguay. Anyhow, this is awesome and I will return as often as possible during my week in this area!
When it's on... it's ON!!!! Unfortunately over the past few trips it's been kind of a hit or miss. I grabbed some today to enjoy while watching the games and it wasn't up to par to what I'm used to. Since it's nearby, I'll give it a another try or 2... but now I'm hesitant to say "You have to try it" like I once was.Quick update: I had some of my friend's and their chicken was on. I guess they got the "hit" and I got the "miss".
Mmmmm. That is all.(As Seen on TV list: Anthony Bourdain No Reservations)
"Dude, we gotta go here!"That's all I heard about this place. Being the patient man of mild disposition that I am, I calmly inquired why I needed to travel so far from the luxury of my hotel room's a/c to eat some chicken? "Because you have to." That (and the promise of good food) was enough for me. Well, after traffic, getting lost and sub-Saharan heat, I, shockingly, was no longer the meek wallflower many know me to be. I rationally asked where we were and when we'd arrive and shortly thereafter we were there. As was half of Virginia.I stood. And waited. Crept up an inch. Stood. Waited. Repeat. After a long time gone, I finally made it up to the counter to order. Surprisingly to all around, my patience was a wee bit stretched out. It was hard to see the menu from the beads of sweat pouring down my brow and into my eyes. With my last bit of strength, I managed an order: "1/4 chicken, fries, slaw, two of that green sauce and a coconut water." I barely made it to the table before my legs gave out from heat, hunger and exhaustion. This d@mn chicken better be worth it........As I ate, Meg Ryan from When Harry Met Sally has *nothing* on me. Nothing. Ya heard? What is in that chicken... and can I give it my number? Call me!
I don't even know what to write in this review, except yum. As in OMG, yum. OMG, I get why Antonio & his friends call this "Crack Chicken".  OMG, you will be back. Probably the best tasting chicken I have ever eaten - juicy, tender, and tasty. I love that if you order a whole one, they quarter it for you. I love the fries (was hoping for yucca fries, but I love all fries, so...). They sell Strawberry Fanta and Inca Kola. Service was friendly & fast, and there were enough tables, even though the place was packed. Only issue was the parking lot, but if you circle the block a few times, you should be able to find a space. No need to write a long review - this place is great. Go. Now.
chicken was great (wonderful seasoning, disappointing skin)cole slaw was not (sweet, mostly mayo, tastes like the slaw at most peruvian places)fries were ok (kinda floppy, but my wife liked them)better than: crisp&juicy, edy's,As good as: chicken place, Super Chicken, peruvian chicken and steakI'll go back when i'm in the area
I was in Virginia visiting my sister when she brought me here. I must say it was perfection! The chicken was cooked to perfection. It was tender, juicy, and just the right amount of flavor. It comes with the basic sides of fries and coleslaw. Short to say, it was love at first bite. The price was perfect, the chicken delicious, and next time I'm in town I'll be there.
AMAZING chicken, fries, and sauce. Enough said.
Simply addictive.  The best in VA. Parking may be hard to find during dinner time. Wish I didn't have to drive so far to eat good Peruvian chicken. I just hope their chicken is not full of hormones and anti-biotics... Well, I can indulge myself once in a while, even if their chicken is radioactive.
Cash only. You can get a quarter chicken, a half chicken, a half chicken all white meat, or a whole chicken. Sides are French Fries and/or Cole Slaw. All of it is amazing. Make sure to mix the green chile sauce with the yellow mayo-like sauce - more green = spicier, less green = less spicy.As far as the chicken goes it is the juiciest, best tasting rotisserie chicken I've ever had.Actually, I just had lunch here today, and discovered that they have added rice as a third option for a side now. Not that I'd get anything but the fries & slaw, but its there for those that want it I guess.
What can I add? Good food, not expensive, no choice of sides. Who doesn't love a quarter chicken with fries? I could use a better selection of sauces; the jalapeo sauce isn't spicy to me, and I don't eat mayo. But who am I to mess with success?
ay dios mio! this chicken is oFF dA HooK GoOd!!!!!!!!! easy to reach by metro, but also has an ample parking lot. i came during lunch during the week and it was PACKED -- all the tables were occupied and people kept streaming in for carry out. obviously these people know what they're doing.the chicken is just out of this world. unbelievably tender, juicy, and flavorful. prices are extremely reasonable and the customer service is friendly and responsive. i really enjoyed the fact that the customer base is completely diverse -- you'll see central american families with three kids sitting down to eat beside guys in suits who are sitting beside truck drivers. i LOVE that!you should seriously go to this place right now. RIGHT NOW!
I don't want to get beat up for giving it 3 stars as it seems that this place is a NOVA fave, but I just DON'T see how this place is 5 stars. I guess this review caters more towards my personal preference and I'm not a fan of the seasoning on their chicken.... Or maybe I just don't like peruvian style chicken period... don't mind me.
great chicken, i believe a whole chicken was around $15 with 2 sides, more than enough for 2 ppl. french fries and cleslaw were both pretty average, but the chicken more than makes up for it.kind of sparse interior with plenty of seating, I've always gotten takeout. Customer service is pretty good, i'm usually able to get in, get food, and get out in under 5 min. seriously, this chicken is fantastic.
Best Peruvian style chicken place in town. Although they say they do not inject anything into the chicken, it tastes as if it was injected some yummy stuff. Perfectly seasoned and charcoal grilled chicken. I love their green sauce and the cole slaw too. The only problem is the parking.
The chicken is always superb when I go there for lunch during the workdays, but during the evening and weekend its not quite as great... I've been going here for close to 2 years now and always paid $5 for 1/4 dark, 2 sides and no drink . Last weekend I went and it was $5.66... I said to the lady "prices went up again huh?" ... she gave me a funny giggle and said "no, its been the same price for 2 years"... i gave her a little laughed too. There were a lot of tourist there that day... price inflation for tourists? hahaha... regardless, I will always go back for the yummy chicken.
Do I need to add more to the glorification of this place? Yah! The place is awesome, period. Its fast food at its finest and simplest forms possible, no value menu, no combos, you get your chicken, fries and coleslaw. How hard is this that? Oh, and did I mention it taste great!
There needs to be some type of investigation on this place. I'm quite certain there is a meth lab in the back and the chemicals are mixing with the food...that MUST be why it is so good and so damn addicting. If you decide to go here then I suggest you also get a gym membership or some running shoes because you won't be able to stop eating here and you will need a way to work off all this food. And the price? Are you kidding me? This place is a treasure.
Excellent place for chicken. The fries are cooked the way I like - perfectly crispy. I used to get the slaw, now I pass. The yellow sauce is awesome - ask for two. I too have been going to this place ever since it was near the 7-11, and I am AMAZED that the price(s) have stayed the same - that's over TEN YEARS of the same price - who does that?! That alone makes this place 4.5 stars bump up to 5. It's no quiet date place or anything, but a great place to get a no-frills good meal that's totally affordable and tasty (AND the bathroom is really clean for a place like this - me likey!) I need to take some photos to post because the ones available as of this posting date just don't do it justice
Really great Peruvian chicken! El Pollo Rico is no frills, simple cuisine, tasty roasted chicken (go dark meat), fries and slaw. The herb encrusted skin of the chicken is addictive, I find myself craving it at odd hours. I would advise staying away from the Inca Cola. I ordered an Inca Cola b/c I observed most of the people at El Pollo Rico doing so (when in Rome!), but I have to say Inca Cola is just about the most sugary sweet drink substance I've ever consumed! I pass on liquid crack so it will be Water or Coke next time...
The chicken is juicy enough to salivate over and you get a great value for your money. It's not possible to leave hungry, but it's very possible to fall asleep at the wheel on your way home. I was disappointed by the alfajores though. The manjar blanco filling had an artificial taste unlike the ones I ate in Peru. But to be fair, I've had alfajores from other places in the area and their filling has that same artificial taste.
One of the best peruvian chicken in the area. Simple and straight to the point, chicken with a side of fries and slaw. You can't go wrong with this place, esp for the price! 1/4 chicken, 2 sides for $5. They have the best chicken, it's jam packed with flavor and juicy! A must try if you haven't done so already!
Eh kinda overrated, while not bad I always pick Super pollo right up the street, it offers better tasting chicken and REAL sides. Fries and coleslaw? give me a break. Wouldnt you rather have some yucca fries, plantains, or chickpeas? Yeah its good chicken but people saw no reservations or hear about how great it is from friends and accept it as the best. If you love this place at least give Super Pollo a try and compare for yourself.
I cannot explain how badly I crave El Pollo Rico on a daily basis. The seasoning on the chicken is to die for, and the yellow sauce that comes with it is amazing. I'm usually not a steak fries person, but I've never once not enjoyed my chicken and fries here. The chicken is super juicy and I always find myself wishing I could have just a few more bites. If you go over lunch, expect the place to be packed, but since the chicken is always roasting, the line moves really quickly. The staff is always super friendly and the food is really cheap. Ahhh, just writing this review makes me want to walk there over lunch.
I'm no expert on Peruvian food. I just know that the roasted chicken is superb, AND the skin is, oh my, delicious!My usual:1 whole chicken to share with my boyfriend + home-made rice = nice dinner after a hard day of work.
Staight up fantastic chicken. I've had chicken from almost every place in Arlington, but this was my favorite. You must try the sauces too. Make sure to get enough of them. Great lunch place, but a quick dinner after Gold's gym works well also.
Best chicken I have ever had. With something of a freeze like cocaine numbing of the lips with the first few bites. From there it is purely blends of pepper and other spices smashing into your lips and gums making you take notice of how great this chicken truly is. Sad part here it seems all the prep in this house goes into the chicken with not much left for the sides. I find the fries a let down and starchy and everything here pails to the enormity of the main dish ( the chicken ). They only take cash and I willing hand it off like a guy looking for the real thing. It may be a hike for me and yet every time I eat somewhere else for this kinda food. I find myself yearning for the time to cross the bridge.
I have been going to El Pollo Rico since it was in the smaller location by the 7 eleven. I know that some say that you don't get choices for sides. But I can say that I have tried other places and they don't have anything on their chicken. The chicken is always juicy and their sauces are fantastic. This will always be my number one for Peruvian chicken
This place has all of the elements of a great hole in the wall. It's dirt cheap, it's got kind of awful atmosphere, and it's cash only! I got a quarter chicken with slaw, fries, and the two sauces (mayo + hot green stuffs) for only $5 and I couldn't even finish my meal. What a deal! :) My only beef with this place was that my chicken was burnt! As a result, it was sort of dry and not as yummy as I'm sure it should have been :( Saddd! The sides were very tasty though. I think that I'd come back though and give it another try :)If only I still lived in Clarendon... :)
Really fast. Like, super fast.The menu isn't large, and that's a good thing - order how much chicken you want and then pay and sit down (or get it as take out). Food was/is delicious.
My favorite Peruvian chicken place. I used to live a few blocks away and went all the time. Have since moved away, but still drive out of my way for it. Consistent, delicious, friendly - can't go wrong here (just make sure to bring cash..and try the cookies , I forget their name, but two cookies on the outside, with a caramel filling).Yum!
For some reason I thought I had been to El Pollo Rico before, but I was mistaken until Jay and Shannon told us of this great Peruvian chicken place they went to hidden on the street across from Carvel in Virginia Square. Thank goodness they did because out of the 2 other Peruvian chicken places we tried this is by far the best. Super juicy, crispy chicken and really good fries! While hidden it looks like many know about it as it was continuously packed the whole time we were there. Service is fast and easy (once you figure where to stand and order). Will definitely be back.
My all time favorite chicken place. No one beats the flavor and the simplicity of this joint. 1/4 Chicken, cole slaw and fries for $5! "WOW! THAT'S A LOW PRICE!" ;p I've been going there for about ten years since they were at the old dinky location and it's still good to this day!Why the four stars and not five: Even when they moved to this location, the line always seems to go out the door. Usually can get my meal within ten minutes of waiting. The line is not the horrible part, it's the parking! Usually best for one person to drive and one person to run in, especially during lunch time when you gotta run back to work. Also, they don't take credit so make sure you have cash on hand.You don't want to miss out on this delicious chicken!
I really want to give this place rave reviews (as if they need it already), but I can't. I've found a better place in California. I won't mention the name of it, because of conflict, but if you hunt my reviews, you'll find it. The chicken here is good. Please don't get me wrong. It's just not up to par with this other place. The spices are great, and the flavour is awesome. It's just...you know, not up to par. Come here for the best, Peruvian, chicken on the East Coast.
Pollo Rico is a delicious local hole-in-the-wall.What it is:A quick, inexpensive, hot meal with impossibly tender chicken, big, starchy golden potato steak fries, and standard-fare cole slaw.What it is not:Pollo Rico is not a place to go for swanky atmosphere, you serve yourself and sit at not-always-clean wooden tables. Also, you must like chicken and fries and/or coleslaw because that is essentially all that is on the menu.Bottom Line: If you like rotisserie chicken and aren't looking for a fancy place, Pollo Rico definitely delivers, just don't forget to bring cash.
This is some of the best chicken I've ever had, and certainly the most affordable. I recommend ordering extra sauce with it--it's delicious, especially the green sauce if you like spicy food. The coleslaw and fries are worth the trip themselves. The worst part about eating here is that I never have leftovers because I always end up eating it in one sitting. It's usually pretty crowded but the line generally moves quickly. Overall, highly worth the trip if you live in the area!
I went here awhile back. This place was actually on the Anthony Bourdain show, which helped to boost its popularity. The food here is excellent, for a low price you get a big hunk of chicken, waffles fries, and a drink. The place has many ovens with whole chickens roasting, which is just awesome. There is plenty of space inside, but due to its popularity the parking outside is cramped. I would recommend this place.
The chicken here reminds me of pollerias down in Peru. They have a great recipe and the constant lines ensure that you are getting chicken that is freshly cooked and super juicy! This is a simple restaurant so your sides are limited to two, fries and cole slaw. The cole slaw is not freshly prepared but the fries are and they are great!
Love this chicken! It's the only chicken place in the area I feel 100\% confident about, AND it's cheap! What more could you ask for?For $5-6 you can get a 1/4 chicken (dark or white meat), slaw (not bad), and a handful of fries (thick cut)! What a deal! The service is always quick and friendly. If you want to splurge try some of their manjar cookies - yum!
Wasn't impressed....ordered the chicken and fries and it was pretty good but nothing to write home about and nowhere i would go back to unless it was right next door and didn't feel like cooking dinner....but their prices are cheap...i've had much better spanish chicken here in Tampa.
Thanks to Tony Bourdain: I would not have tried this particular chicken joint except for seeing it on No Reservations.We hit it up right at noon on a somewhat rainy Sunday, and there was parking and no line. Ordered a whole chicken, but as has been pointed out, if you want more sides, getting 2 half chickens for approximately the same price gets you double the sides. The chicken is excellent, the 2 key points being the spices (in and out), and the moistness of the meat.Normally I don't prefer 'steak fries', but these were very good (fresh). As a coleslaw man, theirs was good (not great).
I saw this place in the DC episode of Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations and went with some friends from out of town to try it out. The location was hard to find as we got confused by the sparse looking Peruvian chicken place and drive-thru around the corner. But, we found El Pollo Rico from the packed parking lot (cars jammed in the street) and a long line of customers that was waiting out the door. Fortunately, the counter service was fast and we had our whole chicken dinner meal served with fries, slaw, and four sauces (a hot jalapeno puree and a creamy mayo). It was finger lickin' good (and not in the KFC way). The rotisserie was juicy and full of flavor. The price was affordable and enough to feed the three of us easily. This is definitely a good place to go if you're in the mood for rotisserie chicken, Peruvian-style!
El Pollo Rico (EPR) does chicken ... and only chicken. Don't expect that you can stroll in looking for beef, pork, or salads. What makes EPR so great is its simplicity. Racks of skewered rotisserie chicken, smothered with cumin and spices, and left to grill for hours results in some of the most juicy, tender pieces of meat hidden underneath a crispy shell. If you're eating with other people, just order the 1/2 regular with slaw, fries, and 2 sauces for $7.34. You may think you're getting a better deal ordering the whole chicken for $13.75 but that's only if you're eating an entire chicken solo. With a whole chicken, you only get one serving of cole slaw and fries. By the end of the meal, you wish you weren't sharing a single serving of sides so you may end up getting an extra order ($1.50 for slaw, $2.50 for fries). And if that's the case, then you'll end up spending more than you would have if you just ordered separately. [Original Visit: May 22, 2010]
Like many of the other reviewers here, I first heard of El Pollo Loco from Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations.  I was surprised to learn that he had featured a restaurant less than a mile from my house that I had never been to.I quickly went to go check out the place, it had some character and is definitely an authentic place with an open kitchen and brick ovens. The menu is simple and includes three items, chicken, steak fries, and slaw. $8 gets you a half chicken, fries, slaw and a couple very small containers of sauce.Their service is quick and my chicken was hot. Warning, the place is cash only, but does have an ATM inside. I enjoyed the chicken, but after seeing it on No Reservations and reading the reviews here, I was prepared to be blown away. While I'll probably head back here next time I am craving chicken, a big part of that is that it is so close to home. If I lived in DC I really couldn't see making a special trip.
Great chicken! That is all I need to say, and all you need to know.  Sides include fries and coleslaw.
Let's see here. Saw this place featured of Anthony Bourdain's "No Reservations" a few months ago. Knew I was going to be visiting D.C. at the time. And yes Bourdain is a badass because he isn't afraid to express his views. But that's not the primary reason I had to try this place. I mean common, YELP doesn't lie most of the time and this place has 4 1/2 stars. Chicken and fries is a damn good meal especially when the chicken is nice and moist and pulls from the bone with no problems.Shared the whole chicken dinner ($13.75) with my family and it came with fries, coleslaw, and 4 sauces. The fries were not soggy so that was a plus. They were however, not the best fries I've ever eaten. Nonetheless, I love fries so I enjoyed every last fry. The coleslaw was very forgettable (yeah fuck the coleslaw) and I would replace it with more fries or more sauces if I could. The chicken itself was perfectly cooked. Extremely moist, juicy and pulled from the bone with no problems. The skin slightly salty and crispy. Even the breast was really moist. The green sauce was chronic and slightly spicy and I mixed it with the yellow sauce which was mayo mixed with something else. Did this place live up to the hype? YesIs it the best chicken I've ever eaten? NoWould I recommend it to others? YesDo I guarantee you will like it? I'd be lying if I said yesParking is a bitch, but people are always coming and going so finding a spot isn't all that bad. There are two lines you can order from. One person asks you how much chicken you want while another gets you the fries and coleslaw. Then one lady grabs you the plates and silverware while the next lady collects the cash money. CASH only. If you try to pay with a credit or debit card here, you are an idiot.
Being half Peruvian and traveling to the actual country where this particular dish that has gained popularity in the US was born, I have yet to try ANY and I DO MEAN ANY OTHER CHICKEN THAT IS BETTER!!!! Personally there is alot of different components that make up an actual good chicken. And how you go about figuring this out... it is quite simple.1. Color - If the chicken isn't dark (your chicken isn't cooked or marinated right)2. Juiciness - and I don't mean Crisp & Juicy. I'm talking about when you rip apart that leg from the thigh, the meat is actually soft and not tough.3. Taste - If the chicken tastes like rubber even a person who has no background in Peruvian Chicken would know that its crap.4. Smell - This doesn't only restrict itself to the actual smell of the chicken. I am talking about getting off the Beltway and being able to follow your nose to that chicken.I have seen alot of people give this place a bad rating because they do not offer a variety of sides. Please note that REAL PERUVIAN CHICKEN made in PERU doesn't offer a wide variety of sides either. The usual sides are French Fries and a Salad. However now we have other chains that claim to be "Authentic Peruvian" but they have tortillas as a side...(Im not even going to touch that). Not to be a biased Reviewer I suggest you drive here to Arlington and taste the hype. I'm sure you will be convinced why there is always a long line at whatever time of day. I have been going to this specific Pollo Rico vicinity back at its other location since I was born. My parents were quite close to the past owner whose photo you will find at the restaurant. In the end it should tell you something that regardless, of the Pollo Rico that exists in Wheaton I will still drive 35 minutes just to stuff my face with the BEST PERUVIAN CHICKEN I HAVE EVER TRIED!
Initially when I came here, I was a little taken back by the atmosphere and simplicity of the menu: chicken. While I'm not a fan of chicken most times (though I love hot wings and fried chicken, haha), I decided to try it out and see where the meal went. There was offerings of a quart or half chicken with sides if you'd like. My boyfriend and I got the quarter pieces and dined in (cash only, by the way). It was certainly a new experience for me to try to figure out how to eat that much chicken and I believe there was a chicken heart still attached to the inside which actually mortified me. But over all it was pretty good. I probably would not eat here again, but others have great things to say about it and it's worth checking out.
This is arguably the most versatile, dependable, and best tasting peruvian chicken in the entire area. Their chicken and spices are money. However, I personally hate their run of the mill fries and lack of any other real sides. Out of the 15+ different Peruvian places I've tried, this place is probably my favorite (now that Super Pollo down the street has closed).
The reason this place has been here for so long it knows that simplicity is key. The place is unpretentious..I was hesitant when I first discovered that this was the place that was so highly recommended, I am far better off for swallowing my pretentious first impressions and diving in.The chicken is pretty damn great. Some people love it but EVERYONE likes it, spiced heavily and cooked for days, the skin is incredible. The fries are proper steak fries, large and full of flavor.The place is basic and I recommend taking it to go but the place really is special and this is proven by the diverse crowd of hungry patrons that wait in line and sit together to enjoy some fantastic chicken.
If you don't care about atmosphere but want really good food in a banquet hall, surrounded by families, go here.Its menu sums it up. -what portion of a chicken?-fries or salad?-drink or no?That's it. BUT, once you have a taste, you'll understand why they don't need frills. Period. The end. Now go and eat, silly.
This place is so freaking awesome. The chicken is sooooo juicy and flavorful (make sure you have a napkin handy though) and the fries are also really good. I'm not a big coleslaw fan, so I didn't try it, but the chicken is all I really need when I go here. Mmmmmmm....
MEH, I'm not sure what all the hype is with EPR is. My bird came literally straight out of the oven steaming hot paired with slaw and steak cut fries. The chicken was decent but not as delicious as I had anticipated. I was disappointed with the choice of sides as they only offer slaw (doused in mayo!) and fries. Where are the beans and rice?!For Peruvian style chicken, I'll stick to Super Chicken.....
Taken here by a local while on vacation. Good sized casual dining room. Chicken was very juicy. Steak fries were good also. Not a fan of cole slaw, so only got the fries. My only complaint would be that soda was in a can, not from a fountain.
Weird that I've never reviewed this place.When the chicken is moist, it's fantastic. When it's dry, it's not that great. The slaw is delicious because it's probably 50\% mayonnaise. When the fries are hot, there's not a lot better than a fry dipped in a combination of the yellow and green sauce. Best of all, for 5 bucks or whatever it costs, it's just really hard to complain about the food, even if the chicken is kinda dry. The dining experience, however, leaves a lot to be desired, and it's mostly due to the customers, not the restaurant itself.Going at any lunch or dinner rush is pretty much unbearable. They really need a "don't sit down unless you have food" policy, because it seems as if 50\% of the tables are being hoarded by folks whose friends are at the back of the 20 minute line. If you're not willing to be exceptionally rude and do this yourself, once you get your chicken, you're in trouble if you want to sit down.Anyway, great spot for a 3 o'clock lunch or 8:30 dinner. Terrible place to go at normal lunch or dinner hours.
I figured that I caught this place on a bad day during my first visit, so I decided to come back for another try. Well, the chicken tasted the same to me this time around. There's something about the seasoning that tastes like soap, and it's not good. I'm not sure what it is about it that everyone else seems to like. The meat was moist, but it wasn't enough to overcome the bad taste. You all can have this place. I'm done with it.
O HARRO?!?Do I smell perfectly seasoned and cooked chicken?Do I smell yummy and spicy green sauce? Do I taste cold and crunchy coleslaw?Why yes I do.This place is very unassuming and people rave about it - and for good reason! Everything about it is just....simply....good. This place can convert an elitist food snob into a believer. Amen and Hallelujah!
My friends took me here during dinner time. I like it.I'll just list things and get to the point.-Chicken was tender, full of flavor. Size of chicken? A little small.-Coleslaw was delish. It Kind of remind me of Popeye's slaw.-Their green and white sauce was YUM.. but i think they charge for extra?-No YUCA!!! WTH Oh heelllll noooo... yeah I sadden a bit.-Cash only.-Price is a tad bit high.-Place is pretty big with good amount of parking out front.-Service could be more friendly but who cares food came out quickly. :)Would I go back? YEP, but it won't be my first choice.
I am rating this as a Peruvian chicken specialist rather than a fast food joint, so I am going to lean 3 stars rather than 4. If I am looking for some very good fast food and happen to be in this part of Virginia, then this place is a winner. The chicken was fresh made and the skin had a nice crunchy crust. A good sign that it hasn't been sitting around too long. Not surprising because the place is packed and they are turning over chicken very quickly. For $8 you get a half a chicken, fries and slaw. Better deal than KFC, but so much better and healthier. For fast food, 4 stars. Now as a Peruvian chicken specialist, this place does not even come close to Flor de Mayo in NYC (the benchmark for Peruvian rotisserie chicken as far as I am concerned). The chicken was a bit under seasoned and a bit dry. Still moist enough to enjoy as a fast meal, but not as moist as Peruvian chicken should be. For taste, I would have to say that this is a three star Peruvian chicken. If you live in DC and love this kind of chicken, hop on the Bolt bus to NYC, go to the upper west side and enjoy how Peruvian chicken should taste at Flor de Mayo. It might ruin you for all others.
I've been eating at el pollo rico for 15 years since it was introduced to me while interning at a Clarendon business. From the first bite I fell in love with the place. Don't let the lines fool or dissuade you. Yes, the parking is a bit tedious, but it is all worth the time to experience the delicious and simple food this place has to offer. While the sides are not as plentiful as other Peruvian chicken joints, there is something special about the simple combination of the chicken, those tasty condiments of chopped jalepeno, steak fries, coleslaw an an Inka cola that is incredible. The chicken of course is the highlight and is cooked to perfection. Never dry, even the white meat, it leaves you wanting more. I am often amused at the tissue paper thin napkins they provide that are never enough to dry ones hands after eating(and yes this is eat with your hands chicken not knife and fork). I finally figured out that you should never be too embarrassed to lick your fingers in addition to politely wiping with the napkins. It's comfort food at its best for me.
I still love EPR. I made sure we visited during our last visit to the DC area. It's that good.
El Pollo Rico is a place to hone your groups teamwork skills, you need at least three people to eat here properly. You need one person to try to park the car, another person to stake out a table, and a third person to buy the chicken... and oh man is it good chicken. You can get a damn good, artery hardening meal at a bargain basement price. Like everyone else has said, they only take cash, the lines are long, all they serve is Chicken, Slaw, and Fries. But, if you are ever in the area of this place... go... go now... well.. wait until they are open.
Almost unbelievably good Peruvian chicken at dirt-cheap prices...just about the only genuine criticism I can level against the place (and who cares about styrofoam trays in a restaurant like this anyway?) is that they don't offer fried yuca as an alternative to the usual, somewhat boring french fries. Bar that, this is as good as this stuff gets. Amazing.It gets packed at lunch-time, though. Don't expect to find a parking spot without waiting for a solid 10 minutes in the middle of the street. Might be smarter to pay a couple bucks for parking nearby and just hoof it.
I can think of nothing better than this chicken it is absolutely the best I have ever had. Not only is it good but its cheap to, my only grief with this place is that they charge you extra for additional sauces and the lines are ridiculous other than that enjoy the food my friend!
Best pollo around - a regular lunch stop for my office on Washington Blvd. I've eaten pollo a la brasa in Annandale, Bailey's X-Roads, Arlington, and Peru, and this is my favorite chicken. The lack of choice in sides bums me out a little - I love yuca and there are only steak fries, but $5 even (cash only) and you won't be hungry for hours. Great bargain and great flavor.
I know this is the original but it's ok. The chicken is nicely char but I just don't get the hype of this place. It's probably because I really prefer to get yucca fries instead of french fries.
I have a friend who lives in DC and won't cross the river to meet me for lunch unless we go here. That's how good it is. This place reminds me of the better pollerias in Peru.Its simple, good food. Your choices - a quarter, a half or a full chicken. Sides are essentially cole slaw and fries.It's cheap, which will make you love this place even more. We got a whole chicken with the sides for less than 15 bucks. We couldn't even finish the whole thing.This place gets packed around lunchtime. The service is quick, and there's lots of seating. I won't say there's a lot of ambiance, so if you need that you might consider getting it to go.
YUM! I don't generally like cole slaw but I LOVE theirs. The chicken and fries are Yum Yum Yum! They only take cash.
I have been eating Pollo Rico since I was a teen and moved to Arlington. In my opinion it is the best Peruvian chicken in the DC area. Nobody can duplicate the mild sauce and the fries are awesome... but the chicken... oh the chicken... it melts in your mouth. The seasonings are wonderful. I crave Pollo Rico often! The line moves fast even on a busy day (everyday).
Mediocre at best - with limited sides and even more limited flavor. Not sure what people see in this place. Super Pollo is better.
Pollo Rico is iconic to Arlington as Ben's Chili Bowl is to DC. The only difference is that Pollo Rico is as good as it's always been for years, whereas Ben's is crappy can food quality only suitible for drunks and tourists from the Midwest. The chicken has a good balance of spices, tenderness and crispy bits that you can't find anywhere else. Most places miss the mark especially overcooking, but Pollo Rico has been been pumping out consistant quality ever since they were on Washington boulevard. They have gotten a little skint with the sauces since then. I think they charge 25cents a pop for any extra. As far as sides go it's still slaw and fries. I always go "solo papas" coz they are some of the best fries in the metro area.
Oven roasted chicken. It's really freaking good. I don't understand how some people give it 1-2 stars. They must have been there on a "bad" night. They should try it again...I eat at this location 1-2 times a month, and I love it. I've tried a few of the others...but the chicken isn't as good. If there is an objectively "better" or "best" place in VA/DC/MD...I feel like comparing them would be splitting hairs. It would be like trying to compare the experience of winning 1 million dollars in the lottery to the experience of winning 1.1 million dollars. Honestly, who cares? It is HIGHLY UNLIKELY that you will regret visiting the location on Kenmore St in Arlington.
Jenny-The chicken is so juicy and the spices are just perfect. The chicken really doesn't need any sauce, but dipping the chicken in the spicy green sauce mixed with the white sauce is really good, too. We got a whole chicken and split it, although Jon ate a half and I only a quarter. The cole slaw is average, and the fries were a little soggy, but I couldn't help dipping them in the white sauce and eating them! Jon made an omelette out of the leftover chicken this morning, and it was scrumptious! Jon- Honey, you're right. This place is really good! I think it edges Super Pollo. The chicken is just slightly more juicy, the spices more exquisitely balanced, the sauces more addictive. The white meat was almost as juicy as the dark meat, which is rare. You don't get too many options on the sides though- coleslaw and fries (which are just a vehicle to eat more of that yellow dipping sauce) are okay. We tried an Inca Kola with our meal- Jenny had one sip and pronounced it vile- tasted like bubblegum toothpaste, she said. I wasn't so harsh, but I would have stuck with a Coke too. In all, this chicken is AWESOME! Go here, I promise you won't be disappointed!
Order quickly and then take your chicken and start in. Make sure you get the 2 sauces (and I like to mix them) for the fries. I am a dark meat guy, but even the white meat was fantastic. This place is the true meaning of do 1 thing and do it well. Their chicken is absolutely fantastic. Get here if you are in the neighborhood.
I try and eat here at least once a week....I don't know what else to say other then TRY THIS PLACE!I recommend going either before or after lunch as the line can get a little too long for me. Make sure you get extra sauce (both Green and White) and mix them together.....Again TRY THIS CHICKEN!!!!! You can thank me later.
Cheap, easy, and delicious. El Pollo Rico is easily the best Peruvian Chicken in the area. Simple marinated chicken that is cooked over a charcoal fired rotisserie. Ordering can't be any easier. You can either get a 1/4, 1/2, or whole chicken. No matter the size, the chicken is consistently moist, the skin is delicious, and the seasoning is just right. All platters come with fries and 2 different sauces on the side. The white sauce is similar to mayonnaise and is my favorite for dipping the chicken. The green sauce is chili based and hot, so be careful. The interior is open and utilitarian. Think more cafeteria than restaurant. That is all part of the appeal. You come in, get your chicken and some Inca Kola (tastes like bubble-gum soda), and watch as dozens of customers stream in and out of this little hole in the wall. Credit cards are not accepted, but there is an ATM as you walk in the door in case you forgot to bring cash.
I've never tried Peruvian chicken before, so this was a first. The chicken was flavorful, but the fries and coleslaw, I was not a fan of. In terms of everything else, the price and portions are reasonable.This place is over hyped for the most part though. I'll pass.
This is the best Pollo Ala Brasa! Do yourself a favor and try this place. I have been going for years and it has stayed true to quality time after time. If your visiting the DC Area go try this place it is 1 block from the VA Square Metro on the orange line. There is a good reason Anthony Bourdain from the travel channel came and reviewed this place. So go find out for yourself and ENJOY
Quite simply, delicious! There can be a wait, but the it's never that long (it might take longer to find parking in the lot!) The chicken is perfectly seasoned and cooked, and still juicy and flavorful on the inside. I also love the accompanying sauces! Bring cash as they do not accept plastic.
I used to go to El Pollo Rico's old location in Clarendon all the time, it was fantastic. I went to the new location in Arlington today. I was disappointed.The web site does not mention any hours, which is inconvenient, and it turns out that the menu they have on the web site is not the same as what is in the store. I planned to get a whole chicken and some sides for a group of 8 people but they didn't have the empanadas, tamales, or plantains advertised on their web site.A whole chicken ran me about $15 -- which is pretty expensive for a chicken in my opinion! The only sides they actually had were fries and cole slaw. The fries tasted like they had spent years in the freezer before being fried and were mealy and soggy, like high school cafeteria fries. The cole slaw came out of a gallon jug. So you are left with the chicken.It was good, however not the perfection they have the reputation for, and not worth $15. Decent seasoning but the skin was soggy, the meat was tough, and it was not throroughly cooked.I won't ever go back, especially considering all of the other places there are to go. Going to this place means you have to make another stop somewhere else for sides.Oh well -- they were great for a while.
We got there at 10:45am on a Sunday morning.. 15 minutes before they open the doors. We were technically the first car there, but immediately after us.. about 4 or 5 cars showed up behind us.. We definitely knew we had hit the jackpot. We ordered a whole chicken to share between my gf and I.. it was $14.99 after taxes and everything. it included a big order of fries and cole slaw.. and 4 sauces. The fries were okay.. we ordered it to go.. so the fries were soggy by the time we got home. The cole slaw was decent. I actually enjoyed it more than what other people on Yelp have said. The chicken was amazing! So moist and flavorful. It was like the flavor sunk deep into the chicken breast.. so delicious. The skin is crispy and flavorful. Really delicious. The food was very filling and the line moved quickly. They take cash only and there isnt much parking in the parking lot.
3.50 stars. El Pollo Rico provides spicy Peruvian style chicken at reasonable prices. Orders typically revolve around 1/4 chicken, 1/2 chicken, or whole chicken with two sides. We ordered the fries and cole slaw along with a 1/2 dark chicken. The fries were blimpy, banana shaped oddities with little flavor and a supple, giving texture. I prefer thin, firm, well seasoned fries. I would not order them again. The mayonnaise drenched cole slaw contained sharp shreds of cabbage with tiny speckles of carrot. Unless you love eating plain mayonnaise, I'd probably recommend against ordering it. The chicken, on the other hand, is worth your time. Unlike most chicken places, the spices here truly permeate the entire chicken making the provided dipping sauces somewhat unnecessary. The chicken was soft and tender without tasting undercooked. In short, it was perfectly cooked and pleasantly spiced. The accompanying green sauce adds an additional kick of spice, but I prefer the refreshing mayo-based yellow sauce. On a subsequent visit, I'd probably just order dark or white meat chicken and supplement with veggies at home.
Good Peruvian chicken, but they get way to much credit in the area. I held the First Annual Northern Virginia Chicken Bowl last summer - a true blind taste test of the top 6 chicken joints in the area based on Yelp, Zagats, and recommendations from long-time locals. I fully expected EPR to win convincingly. Well, after 80 votes were cast, they placed a distance 5th with 7 votes. Not bad chicken, but if you want truly the best Peruvian Chicken in the area, go to Super Chicken in Falls Church (1st place with 38 votes) or Crisp and Juicy (2nd place with 27 votes).
LOVE THIS PLACE! My girl turned me on to this place and I later found out it was featured on the WDC episode of Anthony Bourdain's show. This chicken is amazing and you can get enough to feed a family for days. When I first started coming I noticed a lot of Hispanic people inside (which is always a good sign) but now this place is wildly popular with everyone. The yuka fries are great but my favorite part is the yellow and green sauce. Yum! They come in small containers so stock up, the green is really spicy and you may only need a few but the yellow sauce is my favorite. I like to put hot sauce in it. I wish I knew the names of the sauces.
Going here for lunch makes me excited. It's delicious chicken and it's pretty cheap. I can't say I've ever had better chicken on the bone (any style). One of the few redeeming things about working in Arlington.
I had received numerous dirty looks from my Arlington-native friends when I said that I hadn't eaten at El Pollo Rico yet so one of my friends generously offered to strip me of said virginity a couple weeks ago. We went around 1 pm on a Saturday and lucked out because it wasn't packed. I got the quarter white with double fries (!). I must say, it was pretty delicious. The chicken was steaming fresh, with a good amount of flavor. I was amazed by the tasty fries because most steak fries are pretty bland. And the secret yellow dipping sauce is so damn tasty! Can't beat the price either. I will probably frequent this place often.
Like the hundreds before me...the BEST Peruvian chicken around. 5 stars for the chicken; however, a few things to consider.... No yuca. And their fries are blah. Usually soggy once you get them home. Cash only. ehhhhh....not crazy about that idea. First, if you don't have it on you you have to use their machine which just adds to the price of your meal (although to be honest I can't remember if it charges a fee). But the part I don't like is this new movement toward cash only businesses, especially those of this particular orientation. It seems to be just a reason to mask sales and revenue, to pay workers under the table, and to encourage "undocumented workers" (being PC here). If they took care of this and I had some confidence I wasn't somehow supporting a network of money flowing one direction and people the other I'd feel a little better about eating here......But oh well, the food is great!!!
I echo the statement of others: best Peruvian chicken ANYWHERE. They roast it on little spits (sp?) right there in front of you and take a big ol' butcher knife to hack that chicken in half or fourths as you order it. The fries are big, salty steak frites that taste oh so good in the "I don't want to know what it's made of, it just tastes good" probably mayo-based yellow sauce. They always have a huge line, so prepare yourself.
Winner winner chicken dinner! El Pollo Rico has officially been added to my rankings of totally tasty chicken locales. I've been a repeat customer and haven't had a bad plate of chicken from EPR to date.There's not a bad choice on the menu but my personal fave is the quarter dark with fries. Seasoning is on point-- not too salty and not a bland bite in the bunch. I'm bummed that they only have fries (and not yuca) but they're cut thick so if I close my eyes and hold my nose, I can at least pretend they're yucas. Don't forget to wash it all down with a can of some Inca Kola aka liquid candy and you're set. One thing that really won me over at EPR is that they're willing to give you an extra condiment side if you request it. That mild sauce is like crack!! Another thing to note: remember to bring cash with you, because it's cash only. If you forget your greenbacks at home, don't worry-- they have an on-site ATM.
I had the chicken, and it was delicious
This is good peruvian chicken. You have to try it with the spicy, green pepper sauce....don't know the name of it, but it has a nice kick to it.  The steak fries are ok, nothing to write home about.
This was the first Peruvian chicken I ever had. It was "good" at the time and the price was definitely a shocker, but compared to the other places I've been, this one is just mediocre to me. But I'd go again anytime if I were in the area.
I have to say I think the Five Star reviews are a bit overstated for this place. I expected it to really roll my socks up and down, but I was a bit disappointed. I had tried Super Pollo a few weeks earlier and based on the reviews I thought El Pollo Rico would be even better. It wasn't. First the restaurant itself wasn't much to speak of. It was very standard fast food, but without any particular character and its location in what looks like a warehouse from the outside adds nothing. Don't get me wrong, the chicken was good. The fries were OK. However, they have a limited selection of sides that doesn't include some of my favorites from other pollo a la brasa establishments, including yucca fries and black beans. It was basically french fries or cole slaw. I also felt the seasoning of the chicken was not as good here as Super Pollo. I haven't been to the new location for Super Pollo yet, but that is my next stop.
I'm reminded of Adam Smith's pin factory when writing about this food hall. El Pollo Rico has been specializing in producing succulent, flavorful Peruvian rotisserie chicken for the past 10-15 years and they have it down cold. The rotisserie maker, the butcher, the fries dunker, the styrofoam box packer, to the slightly-imperialistic cashier---the process cannot be messed with and it is a well-oiled assembly line! It makes for a super quick purchase and no time wasted, even though the order line usually spirals around the corner.  The menu is basic, with the signature chicken, fries and cole slaw, but beauty is in simplicity here. For a reasonable price (about $5-6 bucks), you get well-flavored bird and a couple sides. Their thick, flat steak fries have been deep-fried in just enough lard to produce a crispy outside and a near-creamy potato interior. Perfect for scooping up 1/2 part jalapeno chili sauce and 1/2 part special blend house mayo.  Their slaw is pretty average, but who really cares about julienned napa cabbage anyway? This is a hole-in-the-wall, people!El Pollo Rico is *my* favorite hole-in-the-wall.
Went to El Pollo Rico with some coworkers when I was working in Arlington, now I want to take everyone there. The atmosphere and ambiance are not exceptional but the chicken totally outweighs that. Best Peruvian chicken in the area...the green dipping spice - yeppers that's good stuff. It's like Frank's Red Hot to me...I would put that ish on everything!
Their chicken fully lives up to the hype. Be sure to utilize the sauces.
Delicious BBQ chicken, steak fries, and a cole slaw dinner for cheap! It's usually packed and the parking lot is terrible. If you take the Metro, it's halfway between the Clarendon and Virginia Square stops.
Don't let the nondescript sign and cinderblock building fool you this is the best Peruvian chicken this side of the Rio Grand.
3.25I love visiting my Arlington office, because there are so many different places to eat for lunch. Today I was given two options chicken or kabobs. I haven't had good chicken in a long time so I said lets go get chicken. My coworker said we had to try this location. He claims people rave about it and also his friends will drive down from Maryland to get it. That's a good sign I guess. I looked at Yelp just to see, and I saw the 231 reviews and thought....this is a good thing. Right? So off we went.We walked in and the place was starting to get busy. By the time we got to our table which was about 2 minutes the places was packed. We just made it. I got a chicken with the fries and coleslaw and a diet coke. I didn't care too much for the coleslaw, it had way too much mayo in it, but the cabbage was crunchy. Fries were fine, noting fancy. Now on to this famous Peruvian chicken. I took a bite of the skin and it was good, but nothing I haven't had before. It tasted the same as other places I've been. I next took a bit of the chicken itself. The chicken was very moist and not dried out. Flavor wise again, it was just average. I'm not saying it was bad, it wasn't at all. I didn't completely WOW me like all the reviews said it would. I was really hoping for more, but I didn't find it here. I will come back here again, because the value is good. Lunch for under $9 isn't bad at all. Parking can be a pain if you get there late so watch out. Seating inside can packed fast, so if you go here, go early or go at off hours. I will say it does smell nice inside because they are always cooking the chicken and you can see them spinning around in the kitchen.Ah the fresh smell of grease falling off of chicken.....Mmmmmm!!!!!
Since this place already has 230 positive reviews and was on Anthony Bourdain's TV show: the chicken tastes good.
If you've just moved to Arlington, you'll quickly find that everyone's got their preferred Peruvian chicken joint. None of those that I have tried were bad, so it all comes down to personal preference.Why I like El Pollo Rico better than the others:-Consistently fresher chicken. This place is busier than Pio Pio which is across the street and I've found that it results in chicken that doesn't spend too much time drying out on the spit. I've been here at 10 pm with a line out the door.-Simpler=better. Other places in the area offer a lot of sides, but I've found that they are lacking...El Pollo Rico's fries and slaw are good, and that's all I need.
The BEST chicken in the area. Very tasty portions and the sides (cole slaw and fries) are good as well. I have been eating at this place for about 15 years and it has been good everytime I have been there. Good food for the price.
The best smelling and tasting chicken in the area.
I originally wrote that the Peruvian chicken battle was a tie. But no, ladies and gentlemen, the victory goes to El Pollo Rico. It hit me one day as I was coming home from work and the doors on the orange train opened into the Va Square station. Immediately, I was overcome with a wave of charcoal chicken fumes. You see, the smoke exhausts out of the restaurant and is drawn by winds from the east down through the corridor between Fairfax and Wilson. When a train exits the metro station, it pulls air with it, drawing a blast of hot chicken air down the stairs and onto the platform. You could literally trace a streamline all the way from the train doors to the charcoal pit at EPR. And this story plays out all around my neighborhood. At any time of day, anywhere in a half-mile radius, you will suddenly and without warning be struck by a wave of roasted chicken goodness. El Pollo Rico is Arlington.I even made up a little song, to the tune of the bagel bites jingle:"Pollo in the morningPollo in the eveningPollo at supper timeWhen you live in Va-SquareYou can smell Pollo anytime!"
Good chicken! Limited side dishes. Parking so-so. Lots of tables allowing for a quick lunch.
I grew up on roasted chicken dinners. Like, at least twice a week. Because of that, I tend to shy away from plain ol' roasted chicken in favor of more exciting, spicier fare. But when my sister returned from a school trip to Peru raving about the chicken and Inca Cola, I decided to track down Peruvian food in my neck of the woods... and was pleasantly surprised to find that pollo ala brasa was a DC-area specialty!I had heard great things about El Pollo Rico and trekked out to Clarendon to see what the fuss was about. As I walked around a body shop, I caught a whiff of delicious, roasted chicken and saw the smiles of happy, sated customers-- I knew I was in the right place.After going through the efficient line, I sat down with a quarter of a chicken, cole slaw, papas fritas, sauces, and a can of that revered bubblegum flavored soda. I was stunned by the spice blend on the exterior of the chicken, delectable skin, and, more rare, moist meat that was permeated by flavors of exotic Peruvian seasonings. Add the mustard sauce combined with a touch of the spicy green salsa? A heavenly little slice of Lima in Arlington.
I have been eating at EPR for about 20 years and it is the best. I've often said that if I was on death row and it was the night before the big show I would request a whole chicken, a bag of fries, cole slaw, two Inca Colas and a bunch of both sauces. That right there is life........and death. My most recent trip was just yesterday and as always it lived up to its reputation. The chicken is amazing, the fries crispy, the cole slaw creamy and the Inca cold. The true delicious luck is to find a few fries underneath the chicken. If you're lucky enough you'll know what I mean. The parking lot can be a bit chaotic and crowded but be patient and you will be rewarded. When you get up to the front to order simply say as I do; Half white with everything. With that your taste buds will be dancing in a matter of minutes.
Definitely not the best Peruvian chicken I've had. Super Chicken in Manassas is infinitely better and much less expensive. I got the half white meat chicken meal ($10) and was disappointed with how dry the chicken was. Also, the sauce was rather bland and i found that the spices on the chicken skin didn't really get into the meat itself. it's pretty good, but definitely not great.
When I write reviews, they are normally lengthy. This one, is short.Ef. Fing. Great. Chicken. Religious experience for this type of chicken.Nuff said.
What is there to say about this place that hasn't already been said? The chicken is top notch. The coleslaw is one of the few thats actually good? I am sure the fries come out of a bag in the freezer but whatever. I would pay seven bucks for my half-chicken alone much less the chicken and the sides. I can see this becoming a go to meal when the hunger is gnawing at my stomach and I need a quick fix.
really awesome chicken! no credit cards, no frills. the steak fries are great too, especially when you sop them up with chicken juice. lines can get long as the chicken seems to come out in batches. but it's soooo yummy. eat in, take out, whatever. don't even have to dress up to go!
I am so often disappointed by expensive fancy restaurants. El Pollo Rico is so opposite and I'm never disappointed! Who knew roasted chicken was its own food group in Arlington? A yummy place to go inhale tender juicy yummy yummy chicken. Tip: The first time I went I didn't know fries or coleslaw came with. I just had a quarter chicken for $5, but my friend had quarter chicken+fries+bottle water for $5.96. which one is the better deal?My only wish, is it possible to offer some carbs like rice? that would be fantastic, thank you.
CHICKEN! SPICES! SEXY! What else do you need to know? Why is it sexy? I should slap you for asking. If someone asked me what the word sexy meant, I'd tell them, 'Juicy, delicious, and packed with meat'. Wait, that's not it....let's move awkwardly forward shall we? WHAT TO ORDER: The Chicken (1/4 @ $5, 1/2 @ $10 or one whole succulent chicken @ $15, depending on your appetite , all including sides). If you order anything else, I will seriously question your wo/man hood. THE OTHER STUFF: Steak fries (crispy, solid) and Cole Slaw (chopped up kind, not the stringy kind, not over mayo-y). THE X FACTOR: The Sauces. There are two sauces: Green (spicy) and Yellow (mayo+garlicy). Separate, they form the yin and yang of Peruvian sauces. Together, they meld and create some kind of super sauce child that is both rich and spicy. MIX THE SAUCES! DO IT!!! HOW DOES IT COMPARE TO ALL THE OTHER PLACES THAT SELL THIS STUFF?The chicken is tastier then every single Peruvian chicken joint...if it's on a good night; I've had dry chicken here once or twice. Also, El Pollo serves less sides, but they do sides well, so no minus points from me. To compare directly against SUPER POLLO, here's the breakdown:Tastier Chicken: El Pollo (Chicken is tastier and not as greasy) Sauce: El Pollo (The green sauce from Super Pollo is too watery)Sides: Super Pollo (they have Yuca)Environment: Push (both places are clean and friendly)Winner:EL POLLO RICO (but not as much as you'd think)WHY A 4 STAR RATING? They don't have Yucca (while every other restaurant that sells Peruvian Chicken does) and on the unfortunate case that they run out of chicken (this has happened to me twice), it is a painful wait as you stare angrily at all the other people eating. Otherwise, this review is closer to a 4.5 then a 4.
I've lived in Arlington for twenty years and can't think of any place I miss more than El Pollo Rico when traveling or living elsewhere. You'll find a handful of Peruvian chicken joints in the area but none come close in quality to this place... Simply the best cheap place to eat in all of Arlington.* When Anthony Bourdain of the travel channel did a show on DC area cuisine he made sure to check out El Pollo Rico...
My first and only experience at EPR was pretty good but based on the rave reviews this places receives I have to admit I was a bit underwhelmed. The chicken was very tasty although I think next time I'm going to get the half instead of the quarter. There just wasn't enough meat to fill me up. But for $5, which includes fries and slaw, it was a damn good deal. Damn good. There are tons of these rotisserie chicken joints in Arlington so me thinks I'm going to check out a few more and write a follow up. Now doesn't that sound exciting? No? OK.
The chicken here is phenomenal.  I used to work in Clarendon and went to this place once a month or so (both the old location and the new one on Kenmore).  It's always crowded at lunch but the line moves quickly.  It's cool to watch the guy behind the counter cut up the chicken with the cleaver.  The spices in the chicken make the difference.  I didn't give it 5 stars because it is a little salty for my taste.  The fries are good but sometimes soggy. I love the green and white side sauces that come with the fries - especially the spicy green sauce.
This place is amazing. Its a great deal, tasty, and everyone enjoys it. It brings together the Arlington elite together with those that serve them. And that is saying something. Just go here.
best chicken i've ever had - hands downthe fries are also abfab - if you carry out, ask to put the fries in a paper bag (this do this automatically with a whole chix order) then slightly rip open the bag down the middle and let the steam out - i;ve done this and walked 10 min home and the fries were still crisp
A friend introduced me to El Pollo Rico by ordering a few chickens up for lunch when a bunch of us helped her move. (Needless to say, we weren't much good AFTER the chickenfest.) The chicken from El Pollo Rico is 'fenomenal' -- so well seasoned, so juicy, and white and green sauces are the perfect accompaniment. I definitely recommend the takeout because the atmosphere for eat-in is virtually nonexistent, but your fries will get soggy when you take it home. So there ya go. Try this chicken. After you do, I put it to you -- will you ever help someone move again without demanding this for lunch?
Great cheap eat! I am not a big fan of red meat, so I'm always eating chicken or fish so when my friend told me about this "AMAZING hole in the wall Peruvian chicken place" I was eager to try. And it definitely is a hole in the wall, literally the back side of a building, but the place definitely has a large seating area. There is always a line when we go, but it moves fairly quickly cause all they have is chicken, fries, cole slaw and some desserts. The chicken is super juicy and flavorful, the fries are perfectly crisp and their cole slaw is well cole slaw... can't really mess that up. Their desserts are really sweet and tasty. Highly recommend this place! Even had a friend from ATL who came to visit say they were craving it. And to that my response "haha.. sucker." Cause I can drive 5 mins to get it. I'm a mean fatty friend.Minus a star cause their sauces are in tiny little containers and they charge you for more sauce. I mean cmon amigo... how you gonna make us eat an entire chicken with four little mini containers?
Mmm, mmm!!! Col. Sanders should be afraid...very afraid! The chicken is juicy and tender with a crispy, smoky flavored skin. The fries are fresh (no soggy, half-done ones here!) and the smells that eminate from the restaurant call me from GMU. The price is just right, as long as you remember to bring cash. The cole slaw was lackluster, but everything else (including the mild sauce) was excellent. FYI, if you're in a rush at lunch time, perhaps you should call in. Sometimes the line is out of the door... it's just that tasty.
Loved this chicken and I'm not even a fan of chicken in general. Spices were great and the meat was so juicy. I ordered a quarter bird, which comes with fries and cole slaw and I was plenty stuffed. Fries were great too and I usually don't order/like fries so much. Cole slaw was just run of the mill with lots of mayo. Super cheap! We got a quarter bird w/sides, a half bird w/sides and a soda for around $12. Will be back! FYI: Cash only.
I rarely disagree with Bourdain...and I'm not starting the trend today. EPR is solid, even in the crowded Peruvian chicken racket. Fries are good, not great and the chicken is vastly superior to KFC's grilled mockery. However, Super Pollo is the superior charcoal cooked chicken. You can't go wrong with EPR, but you could go right(er) with Super Pollo.
If you need some good tasty chicken, this is definitely a place to check out. Around dinnertime you can walk in and out in less than 5 minutes with a delicious hot meal. The fries are pretty good too. Great value for the money and always consistent!
Simple and delicious, probably the best rotisserie chicken in the DC area. It's totally Peruvian and the juicy chicken has remained consistent and tasty. The menu is presented with clarity and simplicity, and chicken is all it does. No wonder this place is often packed during lunch hours.
THE #1 thing I missed after moving from Arlington to DC!! This is by far the best peruvian chicken place in the area! Love the fries too! It doesn't get any better than their no frills menu - it's just ridiculously delicious chicken, fries and slaw.
Before you go, please note that this place only accepts cash and only serves one item. Chicken. You have your choice between a quarter or a half chicken. All though, for the half chicken, they just give you two quarter pieces (i wonder what happens to the rest of the chicken?). The chicken itself was cooked and seasoned well and tasted great. However, my girlfriend found what appearred to be some sort of internal organ in her piece, and also the coleslaw tasted too salty. So..if you're not too worried about eating healthy, give this place a shot.
This place is as good as it gets. Tucked in the backside of a building and is kinda hard to find at first. The chicken is to die for. The best pollo around in the DMV (DC, MD, VA). El Pollo Rico always has lines everytime I go for dinner and seats are limited. The chicken is so flavorful and packed with juices bursting with peruvian spices in every bite. This place is a winner. Only flaws are I wish they had more side than papas fritas and they accept credit (cash only).
Does this place even need any more 5 star ratings? It's pretty obvious that its the best Peruvian chicken place in the area. There is a small Super v Rico debate but lets get one thing straight - the parking may be tight and the only currency cold hard cash - but its still the best pollo around. Right now your only choices are pretty much quarter chicken (women folk), half chicken (boys and regular men) and whole chicken (gentlemen and scholars). For sides you get your choice of cole slaw or french fries ... but let's be honest who doesn't go with double fries?Until you can order just a bowl of the skin instead of having to buy the chicken, too, I won't be going here every day. Until then this will be a token weekly lunch.I'm currently planning on opening a restaurant that would allow me to capitalize on the Rico name and ride its coat tails to success. Its going to be called El Perro Rico.
Call me crazy, but the chicken was wayyy to salty for my taste. Chicken was nice and tender though, but I couldn't smell or taste the rotisserie from it which sorta takes away from my expectation. I admit the steak fries was really good with that mayo based dipping sauce since I'm not a fan of steak frieds. I had such duper high expectation from watching Anthony Bourdain and reading all the Yelp reviews. :(
Alright, this is one of my favorite places to eat. If you live in Arlington, like chicken, and have not visited this location, you're missing out on one of the best food gems ever. If you live in DC, get jealous, then hop on the metro to get in on the deliciousness! They, hands down, have the best rotisserie chicken I've ever eaten. The meat is extremely juicy and there's flavor all the way through the meat, not just in the spices on the skin (perhaps they brine their chicken to get this phenomenal flavor).Having moved away from the Arlington area in the past year, this is the one place I miss the most (I used to go here multiple times a week, every week). I just can't find any peruvian chicken that is anywhere close with this! Depending on what you're looking for in a meal however, El Pollo Rico may not stack up to competitors like Super Pollo (Ballston) or El Pollito (Crystal City). El Pollo Rico only does 2 sides which come with every meal, french fries and cole slaw. They do both of these sides great, but it may not be your cup of tea. Also, having been to this place dozens of times, I can tell you the chicken is always good, but you don't ALWAYS get the best they can do. Think 7/10 instead of the 10/10. Probably has to do with the volume of chicken they churn out (with that many chickens turning through those rotisseries, not everyone can turn out perfectly). Although I'll take a 7/10 El Pollo Rico meal over the competition any day. Also, sometimes they run out of chicken and you need to wait for the next rotisserie to churn out the next batch of hot chicken. If there's a line out the door, it's a good bet that they're in a chicken holding pattern.
simply the BEST! enough said
Okay, so you've got the endless debate of whether El Pollo Rico or Super Pollo is better. Here's my answer up front: BOTH are great. Look, this chicken is not be made to understood or criticized....just eat it as quickly as you possibly can and lick your fingers clean.Half chicken plate with coleslaw and french fries. Even though the french fries and slaw won't blow you away, it serves as a compliment to your chicken, a brief break from the juicy, spiced, salty chicken in front of you. Oh yeah, go ahead and mix the spicy green mixture with the mustard - and rejoice.The chicken is juicy as hell, just the perfect amount of smokiness from the charcoal, and covered in a spice mix that sometimes comes off as salty, but mostly comes off as CRACK. Seriously, this chicken is like crack. It falls off the bone, you suck off the meat, you can't imagine who would skip the skin, you want another half chicken even before you finish your wing. I had never had charcoal boiled chicken before, and I daresay I'd eat this over anything off the grill. Any day.Listen folks, this is in the category of fast food - and it pretty much tastes like the best-freaking-fast-food you could ever have. Its the in-n-out of chicken. Yeah thats right, I said it. If someone asked me what the in-n-out equivalent of DC is, it would be Pollo Rico.Complaints? I think the sides are to be desired. The main thing that has Super Pollo going for it is better sides (fried Yucca and Plantains to name a few) which do a great job of giving you a tasty overall experience.Oh yeah, a half chicken and two sides, two sodas, split amongst a girl and a guy, satisfied for under $13 bucks.But man, this chicken is good. I just salivated all over my keyboard thinking about it.
I decided to give them another chance, and yes it was awesome. I will try them a 3rd time, to see if they can win me over 2 out of 3.
El Pollo Rico was a joint that a friend spotted on his phone while visiting the DC area. With all the fabulous reviews, how can it not be great?I guess the photo of Anthony Bourdain got us. The entrance looks like the back part of a restaurant and once you walk in, its setup like a cafeteria. Service is super fast and be sure to order quick since there are always hungry people behind you.Got the full chicken, fries and coleslaw.Once we got it home, sat down quickly for this hyped chicken. In the end, it was just ok. Nothing really special as it was just a bunch of cumin dumped onto the chicken before it sat in a rotisserie oven for a few hours. Coleslaw was good, fries were just ok.Overall, food was good but not deserving of anything more than 3 stars
This is THE BEST CHICKEN you will ever have! Boston Market, Chicken Out and any other random neighborhood Peruvian Chicken joint have nothing on this place. There is a reason Anthony Bourdain spontaneously went here during his Washington DC episode. Out of all the Latin American Pollo Restaurants in the DC area this is The Best. The chicken marinated overnight and then dry rubbed with an unknown family spice mix that is heavy on the cumin. I love cumin. It is then slow roasted over real wood-fired coals for a few hours. People say that sometimes they run out of chicken, but I never go during the dinner rush hours. I have waited as long as a 45 minutes in line before, but I've managed to avoid that ever since. This place is worth going out of your way for. French Fries are the only side dish and I usually add S&P to them and then eat them in the car on the way home. Make sure to order extra sauce! That stuff is crackish. One of the Best Cheap Eats around. Simple and straight forward.
Stated simply --- the best chicken on earth.
It's hard to find a bargain in Arlington that isn't another fast food restaurant. I was a bit elated when my meal which consisted of a quarter white with fries and slaw (fyi...the signage doesn't really explain well that the chicken comes with fries and slaw too) and diet coke came to less than $6.00. Okay...so maybe it's sort of fast-foodie, but I don't count it as fast food if it doesn't air commercials on tv. I got their a little before noon as was catching up with an old friend so we had a rather long lunch (2+ hrs). The line NEVER shrunk the entire time I was there. It's in such a non-descript little building that I never would have noticed it if I wasn't specifically seeking this place out. Kudos to them for growing the business so well via word of mouth. It was awesome!
Holy greasy chicken awesomeness, batman!I saw this featured on Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations. I begged my boyfriend to take me on my last trip to DC and it was the first stop as soon as I got off the plane. In fact, it was probably one of the things I was looking forward to most on my visit!We came in about 2 pm on a weekday. There was a long line already and I then realized this place is CASH ONLY. I decided with the quarter white chicken and was a bit puzzled as to what the sauces they served on the sides were, a mayo fusion and some kind of jalapenos chopped up super finely. Whatever it was, it sure complimented my chicken. Total for my meal (served with yummy slaw and fries too) was $9 something with a pop. They need to have better quality napkins though-they were SO thin and didn't get the grease off my face and hands very well, and my table was covered with them! I'd never had Peruvian chicken before, but now that I have, I feel like there is definitely something missing in my life. Too bad I'm in Denver that doesn't offer anything quite like this. I can't wait to come back next time I'm in DC!
probably the juciest, most tasty roasted chicken i've ever had. and it's a steal -- about $12 for a whole roasted chicken, plus fries and cole slaw. you also have the option to choose either dark or white meat, quarter or half chicken. and there are ample tables for seating. everyone who craves good, cheap food, comes here for pollo rico: working professionals, students, immigrants, blue collar workers. it's a nice melting pot that's rare to see in the DC-area.
Best Pollo Ricon chicken ever, have eaten there for 10 years and now that I am on PacNW I miss this place so much and go there whenever I am back in town.
Possibly the best chicken I have ever consumed! I have no idea what Peruvian chicken actually is but the guy with six fingers operating the cleaver adds to the excitement. The menu is very simple - chicken, fries, slaw, and a few desserts. They offer two sauces on the side, one is mayonnaise based while the other is like a jalapeno puree that packs some heat.This place is ideal if you are in a hurry and want to nab some wonderful, easy on the bank food. Chicken is cooking all day long so you can walk in grab a chicken and run out the door.
We discovered this place recently during an online voting poll for best Peruvian chicken place. Add to that a recent airing of Anthony Bourdain's No Reservations recently shot a bit for an episode on D.C. eateries. Took some family there today for some mid-lunch/dinner. We ordered several variations of the chicken dinners: quarter, half-white, and whole chicken dinners. Each comes with coleslaw and french fries. The flavor combination is incredible: garlic, paprika, cumin and probably way more. The flavors are harmonious and the chicken is cooked to perfection. The french fries are cooked well with not much extra grease on the plate. The cole slaw is tasty if a bit too much mayo (yes, there sometimes can be too much mayo). The side offerings of shredded jalapeno and a mayo/mustard combination are helpful but I wasn't quite sure what to do with the mayo so I dipped my fries in it. Again, good, but maybe a bit too much mayo.You will need napkins. Drinks are cold. Gets busy. Oh yeah, CASH only.Go and eat and enjoy. You will not be disappointed.
Gimme Gimme More, Gimme More, Gimme Gimme MoreGimme Gimme More, Gimme More, Gimme Gimme More.No, I was not rocking out to Britney, I was demanding more chicken from El Pollo Rico dammit!What to say that hasn't already been said? Nothing. It's deliciouso, magnifique, and forces me to drive to Arlington from Great Falls at the most inconvenient times just because I want a piece of heaven off a bird!The times I have gone to EPR that have NOT been crowded would have to be after 9PM Monday-Friday. If you want the yumminess without a side of waiting and crowds, then do yourself a favor, eat a snack, and go pick up dinner a bit late.
Chicken is mouth watering and juicy. Fries are probably the best I have had in the city so far. Coleslaw is not so much and the desserts even less. But when you can feed a family of 6 for $30 and its filling and delicious and not that bad for you (eating chicken only minus skin) it's a steal. The chili sauce is good. I recommend mixing a very tiny bit of the yellow mustard into the chili for a nice creamy flavor then slather it on and gobble it up.Give me a restaurant with great fries and I can eat with my hands then I am a happy gal. Gotta love El Pollo Rico.
*** 4.5 Stars ***Before I begin talking about Pollo Rico, I MUST share the nickname for this chicken joint that my friends and I have been using for years; Crack Chicken.Yes, that's right...Crack Chicken. Why was such a name bestowed upon a popular purveyor of the powerful Peruvian poultry preparer? Because if you're like 90\% of the population you'll be HOOKED after one taste. You'll itch...you'll think about your next chicken fix and will become an addict.So who was the person that first introduced me to Crack Chicken? Well folks it was none other than my Mommy. Years ago when I was a wee laddy my mums brought home some chicken for the family to enjoy. Being the fat kid of the family I tore into that bird like a coyote that had been starved for 3 days (NOTE: We do not endorse the act of starving coyotes or any other canines in the name of humor).As chicken grease splattered everywhere and my hands became covered in spices and juice I asked my Mom with mouth full of chicken, "Where did you get this?!?!" Her response was "Wipe your mouth!" and then said, "Pollo Rico"Since that fateful day the name was etched into my fragile little mind and came up often whenever my Mom would call from working asking, "What do you want for dinner?""Pollo Rico!""No, I meant what do you want me to cook!" would be her reply as she sighed and would ask me to take something outta the freezer to defrost.Anyway, I digress....Yes, the chicken is that good and anyone that has tasted it will tell you that they truly enjoy the combination of spices combined with the rotisserie cooking. Now as an adult I have the honor of working right across the street from Crack Chicken and can often smell the deliciously tempting chicken aromas and unique spices wafting from their ovens to my nose as I get into my car to go home.For anyone that has never been to Crack Chicken, here are a few things to remember. Take them as friendly suggestions from a seasoned Crack Chicken addict:1) If you're going there for lunch, get there BEFORE 12pm! Anytime after noon will have you waiting in a long line especially on warmer sunny days.2) Bring cash! It's a cash only business and there is an ATM, but why pay 3 bux to withdraw 5 dollars for your lunch?3) Quarter, half, white or dark. When ordering you'll be asked if you want a quarter chicken, half chicken or whole. The second question will be white or dark. Try to make up your mind before you get to the counter to avoid the wrath of addicts such as myself that are already gnawing on their hands. :-)4) Mix your yellow sauce with the green sauce. The spiciness of the green will "kick it up a notch" for the flavor of the yellow sauce.I myself am usually there at least once a week to get my chicken fix. The best part of sharing these lunch outing with my fellow addicts is that we all refer to Pollo Rico as "Crack Chicken"All outing to Pollo Rico are always initiated by an email sent around 10:30am with the simple subject line, "Crack Chicken today?" In no time a flurry of replies flood cyberspace with "yes" and "what time?". Sometimes being an addict is quite delicious. :-)
Best Peruvian chicken I've ever had. Period.Difficult to find, but worth the hunt.
What a let down!!!!!! Yes, the aroma outside the building is delicious. But that's about it. I was expecting more of a crispy skin, with some charcoal or fire flavor, but there was none.  The chicken was not moist, it was oily. Not greasy, but oily. The skin was gooey. The fries were ok. The coleslaw tastes exactly like the tubs of slaw you can purchase at a deli counter or Costco. The light sauce - average at best. KFC is better. What you can make at home is better. Anything is better. Save your $$$ and your time.
This is the place to go for Peruvian chicken. This should be the only place to go do, don't visit any imitators. Go to an ATM, grab some cash, head to Arlington, sit down with some chicken and Inca Cola and enjoy. Eat your fries with the green sauce too - it's really good. P.S. I was delighted to see that Anthony Bourdain went here after so many folks told him about the chicken - seriously it's that good! Go now, get dinner!
The best peruvian chicken around town... the best hot sauce... and your meal will not be complete with a can of inca cola.
Much has been written about this place, so I will do this in condensed, Mr. T fashion:Stay in school. Drink your milk. Treat your mother right. Eat at El Pollo Rico.
we arrived at this chicken place on a rainy afternoon for a late lunch. surprisingly the place wasn't packed but had a good size of customersdining in.the line wasnt too long and we got our orders and were seated in less than 10minutes. Whole chicken for only $14.00! comes with side of coleslaw and fries and dipping sauces.dirt cheap! meat falling off the bone. tasty,yummy!!!
Once again Yelp leads me to the promised land in uncharted territory. I won't even bother leaving a detailed review since the fact that 200 people have took the time to review it should tell you something. This is what happens when you specialize in one dish and serve it to hungry Virginians every 15 seconds. Chicken + fries + coleslaw = heaven.
I went here because this is supposedly the "#1 Pollo La Brasa" Place in the DC area. Since I love the Peruvian Chicken Joints, I had to check it out.The place was crowded on a Sunday afternoon, and the menu I found to be happily sparse (I figured, hey, if they only have a few things, they must do it well). I didn't have any cash on me, so I had to step out of line to use their ATM.It was good... the chicken tasty, skin seasoned... but the best? Not that I've had. The fries and hot sauce combination, while better than Super Pollo, still can't match Crisp and Juicy. And the side choices can't match Super Pollo for sure. That being said, it's a good middle ground, if you want Peruvian Chicken that has a decent amount of tasty skin with the best of the standard yellow and green sauces I've had so far, try this place. If you want the best hot sauce, go to crisp and juicy, and for some awesome chicken fried rice, go to Super Pollo. Definitely makes the try anything once list though.
I'll admit it: I went here because Anthony Bordain told me to. But that doesn't change the fact this this place is pretty ballin'. The menu options are limited to chicken, french fries, and coleslaw, which you get with every order, but, frankly, why would you want anything else? The chicken is marinated whole in what tasted like a cumin based mix, and then slow roasted over an open fire. The skin is crispy and the meat is juicy and flavorful down to the bone. I was glad I ordered a half for myself, because I didn't want the delicious to stop. The fries and the slaw were fine, but not really worth writing home about. The chicken, of course, is the real story. Definitely hit it up.
I haven't been to Super Pollo so I can't compare, but I still give Rico 5 stars. Food: The chicken is moist and delicious. The fries are pretty good-- and great for soaking up the chicken juices. I can't comment on the slaw because I'm not a fan of slaw in general, but J likes it.Service: Fast.Other: The smell going into this place is just incredible, seriously. $15 for a whole chicken and worth every penny.
The side are disappointing. The cole slaw is a pale, limp, anemic imitation of good 'slaw. There is no yucca, rice, corn, beans - just soggy fries. The chicken is pretty good - but without decent sides to break up the flavor of chicken, i habituate pretty quickly. The white guy at the cash register ordering everyone else around is vaguely imperialistic.
Hi everyone!I'm peruvian and I've got to say that this comes as close to the original peruvian chicken as I've had here in the states. The chicken is awesome! For those of you wondering what the white sauce is - it's homemade mayo. The best way to eat the chicken and fries is to mix some of the green sauce with the mayo. There is just nothing better! Stanley B. - I have to disagree with you - coleslaw is well and alive in the peruvian culture - have had it plenty of times back home! homemade as well as store bought! I'm not sure where you are getting your facts from ??Anyone who hasn't tried it, should definitely do it :)
OK, I'm sorry, but this place is WAY overrated. Yes, I saw it on the various TV shows and thought I needed to try it. I was wrong. The best word I can use to describe the food from this place is blah...
I'm new to the Peruvian chicken scene, but I've never had chicken so good that I've been gnawing at the bones. Cheap and delicious--the ultimate take-out meal.
Stunningly good chicken. I'm no Peruvian chicken connoisseur, but mmmmmmmm. I've also been to Chicken on the Run (in Bethesda) several times and they're great - but El Pollo Rico's chicken is just a bit juicer and a bit more flavorful. I must say, though, that after going to Chicken on the Run several times, I was very disappointed in the sides at El Pollo Rico. The fries are pretty good, and cole slaw ain't bad... but that's all they have. Chicken on the Run has a great selection of sides from mashed potatoes to fries to rice and beans to fried plantains.
one of the best!
El Pollo Rico makes chickenThat's juicy & finger-lickin'Great coleslaw and friesTo add as your sidesFor lunch, make this your pickin'!Clearly I am no poet, but El Pollo Rico makes a mean, juicy chicken. The slaw is delicious, which is saying a lot because I usually stay away from the stuff. The fries...are fries. Definitely check it out (like everyone else says) for lunch one day!
Whats left to say, grungy little hole in the wall with the best tasting sloppiest chicken around. Screw the complaints about the sides (they really do suck), the chicken alone is enough to give this place 5 stars. Think of the fries and slaw as padding to keep the chicken safe on the trip home.
I've been watching the reviews come in for El Pollo Rico and Super Pollo and had to chime in. My Super Pollo experience was amazing - I actually think I have to up it to 5 stars it was that good. But, this place had been hyped up enough that I had to make the comparison.The chicken smelled amazing, but the taste was not the same. At Super Pollo they do something to the chicken that makes the spices permeate through the skin throughout the chicken, and at EPR that just doesn't happen. I will say that the fries are better here, but who goes to a chicken place based on the fries? Plus, the chicken fried rice at Super Pollo may be one of the best sides out there.Hands down, the victory goes to Super Pollo. My recommendations to EPR: start taking credit cards, go eat at Super Pollo to see how chicken should be properly cooked, and do something about your green sauce. It shouldn't be straight green paste, it at least needs some water.Overal a decent experience but Super Pollo is just that much better.
Hailing from Ohio, Peruvian chicken shacks are not to be found back in the Buckeye State. (O-H....) Coming to DC and NOVA had its pros and cons and one of the pros is that I can inhale whole Peruvian style chickens anytime I please! This place, as usual with most of the chicken places like this, is CASH ONLY. Its a bit of a hassle if you don't have cash, but at least this place has an ATM inside and available to you. The chicken is absolutely delicious. I'm sure business might pick up a bit after Anthony Bourdain visiting here for his TV show and having rave reviews about it, but its worth the adventure to wade through any size mob to eat here. Its decently priced and the fact that it only has two sides shouldn't deter you. After all it is a chicken joint...not a coleslaw house. Its finger lickin' good.
I love roast/dry bbq style/Buffalo/any chicken and this place was indubitably tasty. But I also like my chicken spicy and although the chicken comes with a green pepper sauce it's kinda post-mix and really not too exciting. Also, if you order a whole chicken you don't get a whole chicken (or at least we didn't) - you get 4 quarter chickens which is not the same thing. There was one leg in those four pieces and guess which piece is my favourite... ? The tasty steak fries don't quite make up for that.The clientele make for a really interesting mix, since the place is quite close to Virginia Square metro. Good for people watching. Open 11-10 every day of the week.Negatives - parking can be tight; no fountain sodas (cans/bottles only); cash-only. They do have an ATM inside.
El Pollo Rico is the best peruvian chicken in town. I recommend asking for "everything" at the counter. In return you will be rewarded with a well seasoned portion of chicken, a wonderful coleslaw (with tons of mayo), and a generous helping of fries. Be sure to ask for extra dipping sauces, you will definitely consume at least four (two come with the meal). I like to mix the mayo based sauce with the jalapeno based sauce. El Pollo Rico is a great place to have lunch or a quick dinner. The food is served fresh, very quickly, and at a more than reasonable price.
Let's get one thing straight:There are several Pollo Ricos all over the place. There are some in MD, one in Springfield VA, and a few other floating around the area, but this review page is from the one on Kenmore.The original Pollo Rico was in this tiny little strip (not far from it's current location) that never had enough parking, so they moved to Kenmore a few years ago to work on their parking and dining space issues. This is a Peruvian rotisserie that tries to kind of keep it like home! My father is Peruvian and always in search of great tasting chicken that reminds him of home, and nothing has beat Pollo Rico. The restaurant is family owned and holds tight to their recipe. Most of the people who work there, if not all, are family in one way shape or form. Yes, the two and only sides available are fries and coleslaw but that's normally what you will get at these Peruvian places. Potatoes are a big part of Peruvian cuisine so that's really no surprise that it's the main side. Be aware, that depending on the day you come, depending on the batch that you get, the chicken can be perfect, or sometimes dry. 9 times out of 10 your fine, and dinner is great! But 1 out of 10 times, you get a kind of dry chicken, but the dry is nothing compared to the level of dry you get at other places. This normally happens at times when their line is out of the door and they have all of the ovens cooking. I mean, can you really blame them for incorrectly calculating the time of one rotisserie when they have 3 others going as well? No one can get a perfect result every time but they really do try to here and they're pretty awesome.They now have a few options for desserts which is cool. I love their Alfahores! The cookie like desserts that they have are to die for! They are incredibly messy (but let's be real, eating here can get messy as it is) as they are covered in powered sugar. Their mil-hojas are good too, but I've always been a bigger fan of the other option. They also just recently began to carry candies from Peru which I use to have to wait for my family to send me directly from Peru, so I love it! For those of you who want to keep it simple and are already stepping outside the box by coming here, no worries, they have ice cream too!BEWARE! This place has it's own rush hour! Lunch time during the week is busy but not deadly. Saturday afternoon are pretty packed and Sundays after church are also pretty busy. The staff is really good and getting you your food and checking you out as fast as humanly possibly, it's actually really cool to see how well they all work. Parking isn't too much of a issue of normal days, but if it's a busy day, chances are that you should expect to wait around a bit for a spot. REMEMBER! Cash Only!
My opinion of this place hasn't changed. It's still the best place for Peruvian chicken, ever.Simply put, this place is all about the chicken. It's their delectably-spiced, tender chicken that just keeps me coming back for more. I don't like long lines (but then again, who really does?!), but have been known to wait here in lines which are longer than I'd normally tolerate, because, frankly, the chicken here is just that good. When there are large masses of people continually clamoring for El Pollo Rico's chicken, sometimes you've just got to suck it up & wait, because, as the clich goes, a good thing's definitely worth waiting for, especially when it's been basted with exquisite spices & then slowly grilled rotisserie-style over a flaming pit! :) Without a doubt!I'm also a huge fan of the various sides & dipping sauces, & coming here is probably one of the only times I'll ever even consider breaking my "no-caffeine" rule by drinking Inca Cola. Sorry, but it's just got to be done. Nothing else feels quite right as an accompaniment to this meal. So it's down the hatch & many happy feelings for one's brain & tummy!People claim serious, hardcore addictions to this place, & frankly, it's not surprising to see why. I hope this place stays in business until the end of time, because it's just too good & like many others who claim a passionate allegiance (...er,"addiction"!) to their chicken, I don't think I could live without this place! If their popularity is any indication, let's hope that such a scary possibility never has to be considered. ;-)Viva El Pollo Rico! Long live El Pollo Rico! :)
Best Peruvian chicken I've ever had. I do wish they had more options for the sides but the taste of the chicken makes up for that.
The chicken is the best around and I like that it's in a seedy little strip mall but only having two sides(steak fries and coleslaw) kinda sucks.
Met up with Lester "I can devour 3/4 of a chicken in 30 seconds" K. for a quick chicken dinner before the PIG outing. The whole chicken I ordered sat before me and Lester was 5 mins away. Now, in "having to hold back from eating the chicken"-time, that's like a millennium. There was no guarantee that he would have any chicken by the time he arrived. I started with my 1/4 white meat, because I was hungry. I was underwhelmed. I could actually wait for Lester to arrive it was that bland. Back in the day, at least half would have been gone. I was barely halfway through when Lester arrived. No talking, straight to eating. I finally finish my chicken, look up and he had finished the 3/4!!! Holy crap! But there wasn't the usual bare bones on the plate. Some bones still had meat! That's not like Lester at all. It hurts my soul to have to lower the number of stars, but they are going down hill. The chicken was moist and crispy, but the flavor is lacking. They are tasting just like the new Wheaton Pollo Rico, bland. The steak fries had no salt. The coleslaw is still the same. The green sauce wasn't spicy, and the yellow sauce tasted like mayo. I guess management changed. It's really sad for me. Probably more like 2.5 stars :(
As good as it gets is the perfect way to describe this place.  Yesterday I went in to get my usual half chicken with all the fixin's and I was in and out in about 5 minutes. They have their system down to a science!The spices on the chicken are unbelievable, and the steak fries and slightly sweet coleslaw that accompany it are so good. But of course, the main event is the chicken and it is probably the best rotisserie chicken I've ever had. I live in the District and will think nothing of driving to the "burbs" to get this chicken. Plus - half a roast chicken with sides (not to mention the delicious sauces you get) for about $8 is an added bonus!If you haven't tried El Pollo Rico, I highly recommend it. I don't see how you could not love it!
My first introduction to Peruvian chicken was the old El Pollo Rico location in Wheaton, MD, next to Ranger Surplus. After shopping at Chuck Levin's, I got in my car, which was facing directly at El Pollo Rico. In my state of starvation level hunger, I saw all this smoke coming out of this little hole in the wall, and the line to this place was literally coming out the door. I thought to myself "Self, I need to see what all these people are in line for."Get in line, and the aroma of foreign spices glazed in smoke was, how do I say, erotic. Very erotic. I almost needed 2 cigarettes from the aroma alone. I finally made my way up to the counter and in a frenzy, order a half chicken meal with fries and coleslaw, which were pretty much the only sides available.I still remember my first bite and all I could think to myself was "Holy mother of bejeebus, I've died and gone to the heaven of Flavortown." This was one of the most incredible things I've ever put in my mouth. The chicken was really super juicy, and the spices, oh the spices... there is no word in any language that could have done this justice. To prevent this long story from going on and on and on, which can easily be done, I'll wrap it up.I've been spoiled by having eaten at the old Wheaton El Pollo Rico location as all Peruvian chicken that has followed does not come to being remotely close in terms of its goodness. Sabroso Grill in downtown Silver Spring comes the closest. That says a lot.Now last night, I met up Jimena M. here before going to the PIG outing. Parking was atrocious, but that's OK, as I can deal with parking across the street as long as I can savor down on some El Pollo Rico. At first glance, the chicken looked lighter than what I'm used to.Then, the taste:While the sign says El Pollo Rico. this is not El Pollo Rico. The chicken was juicy, yes, but there was barely any flavor. Spices were minimal to say the least. Bland bland bland. Disappointed would be an understatement. My order of 3/4 chicken was not finished. That's how bad it was. I talked of spitting on the chicken and returning it because this chicken offended me. This was hopefully not the same chicken that Anthony Bourdain ate during his filming of No Reservations here last summer.What have you done with El Pollo Rico, 932 N Kenmore St., Arlington, VA 22201? Please bring them back. I will not return until this impostor is ridded of. This was Peruvian chicken, not El Pollo Rico chicken.
I wish I could call this as the hands down best Pollo in the region; while the ever-growing Hispanic population of Northern VA has caused a great deal of these joints to pop-up over night not all of them are comparable ,not even close. But Pollo Rico always does it right; the chicken is always fresh and never left under a heat lamp like some of the other places. These guys rock. I am still unsure if I like this place best but it never disappoints and always leaves me full and satisfied.
AMAZING CHICKEN! I got a $30 parking ticket for parking illegally outside of the restaurant when I came here last week, and it was still worth it.The chicken is extremely flavorful and the bird was big and meaty. I got the 1/2 all white and just ate the breasts. It comes with fries and coleslaw, which are nothing to really write home about. However, the chicken made up for the mediocre sides (after all, you don't come here for the fries). The entire meal was under $10 and was highly enjoyable.If you're into this type of chicken, you should also check out Don Pollo in Bethesda, Chicken on the Run in Bethesda and Crisp and Juicy in Wheaton and Rockville. The chicken at these places is not quite as amazing, but it's definitely close and they all serve yucca and plantanes.
First off, I don't know. Really.... I have no excuse, I just never went.That's been my answer to a real no-brainer.... "Why haven't you been to El Pollo Rico yet????".Well, I finally got around to going. After two bites, I was posing that question to myself.... however funny it appeared. Some random guy asking himself questions while inhaling chicken and Inca Kola.Seriously though, I loved everything about first experience at EPR. The line going out the door was a clear indicator that I had found the right place. The smell as I worked my way inside confirmed it. The family atmosphere was comforting. The price and the service was right on. And the food.... the food.I really don't have much to add that hasn't been said already. I ordered the half white chicken, with fries and slaw, and an Inca Kola. I don't think I'll be straying too far from that order.... though I will probably pass on the slaw in the future though, it's nothing special.You really have to respect a place like this that has such a small menu. Chicken, fries, slaw.... that's it. To have so little to choose from, you better make damn sure that what you do have is right on. It's nice to go to a place that does just one thing and does it as good or better than anywhere else.The only drawback to EPR is, of course, the parking situation. You probably aren't going to get a spot. It's pretty much halfway between the Claredon and Virginia House stops on the Orange Line, so there really isn't any need to try and drive here anyways.Seating is a free-for-all type thing. If you go with a group, have one of your friends hold down a table while you stand in line. If that doesn't work for you, things move along pretty quickly and something will probably open up quickly.Important note: CASH ONLY!!!!No complaints! This place lived up to the hype! Highly Recommend!!
I ate here for the first time after watching Anthony Bourdain rave about this place on his show. The DC/NOVA region is well-known for its abundance of Peruvian chicken joints, and I've tried many, but El Pollo Rico takes the cake. As others have mentioned, the menu is simple -- quarter, half, or whole chicken, which come with fries, coleslaw, spicy green sauce and mayonnaisey white sauce. The chicken, even the white meat, is super moist and juicy, and the skin is crispy and flavorful. It doesn't NEED the sauces, but I just love dipping the chicken in the white. So good! Oh yeah, and the price is great too. Nothing innovative or cutting edge here, El Pollo Rico just does it better than the other guys.
Best chicken in the area... in fact you'd probably have to drive a hybrid fully charged and fully gassed as fuel efficiently as possible to find a place within range that has as good of chicken. The flavors are complex but supremely palatable. Hard to stop eating it even after you're full. I'm not a fan of the green hot sauce, just doesn't taste good to me. The mayo based sauce is awesome, but i'm sure its absolutely terrible for you. The fries are regular old steak fries, although perfect with the mayo based sauce. Don't bother with the cole slaw... its just cabbage, chopped carrots, and mayo.. lots of mayo. Dont bother, order double fries and double of the mayo based sauce if you don't care about being gluttonous.As a word to the wise, it can get really crowded and Dr. Delivery.com will deliver from them. So you can sit on your ass at home, have a beer, and wait to have someone else bring it to you. How cool is that?
Chicken: tastyFries: steakySauces: electricThis place holds a rare distinction in that my wife and I have eaten here on consecutive days. The only quibble is that parking can get a little hairy during peak times... but don't let that keep you away.
Can you say fire cooked chicken french fries and sweet cole slaw simple but the chicken is full of favor !!!!!!!! it falls off the bone the staff is friendly on busy nights they speed it up and move fast in order to get u in and out love this place !!!!!!
If you're looking for good chicken, this is your place! I'd seen the ratings and heard the reviews, so I headed there late last night for a little carry out. The service was quick and they certainly give you PLENTY of food for your money!The chicken has great seasonings and the sauces (one spicey and one honey mustard-like) were a great compliment.If you're looking for great carry out and you're a chicken fan, you need to check this place out. It's easy to miss, tucked away on Kenmore in Arlington, so don't miss the turn!
Oh man, this is the BEST "pollo alla brasa," and an incredible bargain! We always get a double order of the steak fries and extra sauce -- it's worth it! I like using the left-overs the next nice for "arroz con pollo" -- rice, a can of tomatoes, a little extra cumin plus the chicken -- and I get two nights of incredibly delicious, inexpensive meals. But ooooh, those fries...
There are a LOT of Peruvian chicken places in DC and Virginia - and they all have basically the same name, so don't be fooled - but this one is the best. The chicken's tender and juicy, and the steak fries are exactly what steak fries should be. I agree that they're stingy with the sauces, though. We love our dipping sauces!
Probably not saying anything new after taking a quick glance at the other reviews, but..this is some damn good chicken. Came here after getting out of work early on President's Day (boo to working at all!) needing a big meal, and needless to say I was satisfied.The chicken has a very unique taste, and compared to most other (roasted or fried) chicken places I've been to, this destroys them. Chicken Out is the only place I've been to in the area that compares, but this one takes the trophy.My only problem is that, because it's all about the chicken here, the sides don't get the attention they deserve. The fries are great, but I despise, despise, despise cole slaw!! And when compared with Chicken Out, Rico loses by a mile. Again, I realize it's all about the chicken, but come on - mac and cheese, stuffing, mashed potatoes....I think I'll grab a side platter at chicken out and swing by rico next time - problem solved!!
There's something about the chicken - a spice rub I can't quite place. That's what makes the chicken stand out. I liked the mayonnaise-mustard type sauce, but I didn't care for the green chilli sauce. It wasn't really spicy at all and it had no taste.The fries are thick and crispy and taste great dipped in the mayonnaise-mustard sauce. I liked the coleslaw even if it probably came out of a big plastic jar. If I visit the Washington area again, I would so come back to this place.
Went the for the first time last week. This place is a great hole in the wall. Service was fast and the chicken is delicious. The Yuca fries are a must-get.
I'd like to downgrade them for charging for extra sauce. I just don't think it's the best. Sure the location is hard to beat but the chili sauce wasn't that great this last time and they charged me incorrectly for the sauces. So I'm a little saddened by the carelessness of charging me for six extra sauces when I'd ordered a whole chicken (so I got no sauces INCLUDED with my order!?). And why is it not a cheaper option to just order a chicken with no "meal" items?
The Good:1) VERY Tasty Chicken!!! Whatever spices they use on it are really excellent.2) Cheap. Where else can you get an entire chicken, two drinks, fries, and coleslaw for under $20??3) The Sauces. I was a fan of the mustard sauce, but the rest of the table liked the medium-spicy green sauce.4) Coleslaw? My dining companions decided the coleslaw tastes like KFC's, which they meant as the highest of compliments. These are people with some refined coleslaw taste.5) Solid Desserts. I recommend the pastry thing that is kind of like baklava, as well as the cookie sandwich thing. (I have no clue how to handle the Spanish names, so you'll have to go on description here!)6) Family-Friendly. We had two kids at our table who were very happy with their bites of chicken, fries, and papaya juice!The Bad:1) Not Exactly Vegetarian-Friendly. Unless you are vegetarian who likes KFC coleslaw and lots of mayo.2) CASH Is King. You can use the ATM at the entrance if you don't carry a few $'s on you.3) No Frills. Not necessarily a con, but don't go here expecting luxury: this is a cheap food-on-a-tray and plastic plates kinda place.I should also mention that we went about 6:30 on a Wednesday night and there was never a line longer than 4-5 people during the hour and a half we were there. Very fast service, too!
I'm torn between a 3 and a 4, but, I love small unique places that do one thing REALLY well. This my friends is that kind of place. Don't ever bring a vegetarian here, unless they're not hungry. This is a place for a pure meat eater. I split a 1/2 a chicken with a friend. It was served with coleslaw and fries. I don't like slaws of any kind, a token bite of this slaw did not change my mind. The fries were thick cut but not exciting. You come here for the chicken. The greasy, tear it apart with your fingers, eat until you are in a meat coma chicken. It is served with a spicy green sauce and a creamy yellow sauce. It tasted just fine on it's own, but a mix of the green and yellow adds a kick, the way that wasabi nicely compliments sushi. Be warned this is a NO frills establishment. If I lived close by, I would probably just get it to go and eat at home.
I think I may have been suffering from premature e-fivestar-ulation when i wrote this review, and I have since been reflecting on the limited menu options and inconvenient location.
The chicken is succulent and delicious. I can't quite explain what it "tastes like" but it is super good. I like both of the sauces the chicken comes with too.The only thing I don't like is waiting in a long line to place an order.I highly recommend.
Rock solid. affordable, outstanding food. It can be busy during the lunch rush, but it's always worth the wait.
My former roommate introduced me to this place in the summer of 2006. I later introduced it to my fiance. I have never ever heard a bad thing about this place and if you go, you'll understand why.The chicken is seasoned Peruvian style in a number of spices. It's roasted rotisserie style over open flames that you can see while standing in line. The food comes with two sides and two sauces - fries and cole slaw and a mayo/mustard style and a spicier style. Wash it down with Inca Cola and you've got yourself a great meal for under $10. You can order a quarter chicken, half a chicken or a whole chicken. You can order all white or all dark meat. They have desserts - Flan, cake...probably the usuals that you'd see in a restaurant like this. I guarantee that after the chicken, you'll be so satisfied dessert won't be a word in your vocabulary. The chicken is incredibly moist or "falling off the bone" as i recently heard it described as. The fries, though unseasoned are perfect and the cole slaw is unique and full of flavor as you'd expect a cole slaw to be. Don't be alarmed by a line that wraps around the restaurant, the line moves quickly and the service is friendly. It's cash only so be prepared however, if you're not there's an ATM near the door. I highly recommend this place to anyone - for either eat in or take out. It is by far one of the best places I've eaten at in the metro DC area and one of the cheapest.
Whats there to say that hasn't been said in the past 135 reviews?I only checked this place out because it was the 'hottest' restaurant on yelp in my area. I paid less than $6 for a quarter chicken with coleslaw, fries, and a drink. I've only been to a handful of restaurants like this one and what made this one so much better is the fact that the flavor of the spices was not just on the skin and the outside of the chicken, but it could be tasted deep throughout the entire chicken. Every bite was extremely flavorful. The coleslaw was sweet, but I liked it. The fries were just plain old steak fries, but they were somehow exceptionally good too. If I lived closer to this place, I would go here all the time. For what you get here, $6 is an extremely small price to pay.*The only issue I had here was my own lack of observation, I unintentionally nearly cut a few people in line because I didn't see the "Order Here" sign. Look out for it when you go there so you don't make the same mistake that I did.
Amazing amazing amazing. I can't get enough Pollo Rico. Especially when rents due and the money is low. I truly could eat this every day.
Awesome!!!!! Flavour--5 starsPrice--5 starsAtmosphere-- minus 5stars, but heck, for the price and the food, it's so worth it!I used to live one block away from this place and never went! I judged a book by its cover... Just go and try it. If you're unsure of the atmosphere, just take it to go and eat it at home. It's soooo good!
After reading all the reviews and from the recommendation of Anthony Bourdain from No Reservations, my family and I headed over there yesterday on a Sunday approximately 2pm. I anticipated their parking lot would be full so we parked across the street next to the Law Library. When we got to the front door entrance, there was already a fairly long line of people. It took about 15 to 20 minutes before we got to order. We ordered the whole chicken and a couple extra fries to go with it. And it only took a few minutes to order the food and pay. I noticed there was a system: one person cutting the chicken, another person to plate the chicken, coleslaw, and fries, and another to ring it up. This definitely kept the line moving. Both chicken and fries were served hot. The chicken was just pulled from the spit, and the fries came right out of the fryer so nothing sitting around since the turnover is high. The chicken was tender and moist. The rub was decent. The two sauces, a yellow mayo and minced jalapeno, were a nice accompaniment. The price was reasonable. I don't know if I would come back because after reading all the rave reviews and giving it a try, the chicken just didn't totally blow away my taste buds. The flavors weren't exciting and tasty enough. I am comparing it to other similar places (London, Venice Beach in California) I've eaten. In fact, I've had tastier rotisserie chickens from grocery stores such as Publix, Costco, Trader Joes, and my local Harris Teeter ($4.99 whole chicken specials on Fridays).I would say the best part of their menu is the coleslaw. I don't eat any coleslaw unless it's from KFC. And the one at El Pollo Rico tastes almost exactly the same.
We walked in on a raining evening, ordered a whole roasted chicken, they gave us the bag, we paid, and walked out. The whole process was under five min. For $15, instead of mystry meat burgers from fastfood places, you can feed 2-3 people a fresh roast chicken dinner. The chicken was seasoned all the way through and incredibly juicy. Both sauces, a mustard mayo and a very spicy jalepeno were good. The coleslaw and fries that came with chicken were nothing special, but since the people behind the counter worked with amazing speed and efficiency, the fries were extremely hot and crispy.
I know a TON of people have reviewed this place and said what it's about, which is pretty simple, so I will keep this short. I absolutely LOVE the chicken here. There's a reason my friends and I adoringly refer to it as "the crack chicken place" because it is addictively good!I went with a friend of mine from D.C. who had never been before. He's a pretty picky eater, but he seemed to like it quite a bit. When I used to live in Arlington I'd come here at least once a month. Their prices are reasonable and seasoning unmatched.
Ok, what's so great about chicken, I wondered? Well, this is some damn good yardbird. I got the half white (dark meat scares me), ate half of it, and took the other half home. The chicken is perfectly cooked-juicy and flavorful. It's great! I loved the mayo and jalapeno accompaniments, too. A definite must if you're in the area or in the mood for chicken!
El Pollo Rico is my favorite food. If you consider the price you pay, quality of the food, nutrition, and of course taste, there is nothing better you can treat yourself with. If my wife would let me, I would eat this everyday. This is a must visit if in the Norther VA area.It looks like a little hole in the wall on a side side street in Ballston, and even when you get inside it doesn't impress. Yet, you can tell it is clean and hygienic. Eat here if you haven't yet.
My girlfriend, who lived in DC for a few years, has been raving about this place since we decided to make a trip to see the inauguration in person (from a jumbotron on the Mall).I don't think she would have allowed us to complete the trip unless we made a stop here.Chicken did live up to the hype. The chicken was moist, flavorful from the savory spice rub (is there chimmichurri in the spice mix?) and most importanly, cheap. It was probably the cheapest meal we had during the entire trip.If the skin was just a bit crispier, I would have five-starred this place.
Every once in a while you have a bad day and want to take it out on part (or all) of a cooked bird carcass. For those days, you want to go to El Pollo Rico. For under $6 you can stuff your face full of the best Peruvian chicken in NoVa. Try the green sauce and thank me later.
Bourdain went here!!!!!
By far the best peruvian chicken option in the area. For under 5 bucks, you get a 1/4 chicken and steak fries (and slaw). The dining room is large, and usually packed. You see a real cross section of people here, evenly mixed between families, young professionals and immigrants. The mustard/mayo mixture is perfect when paired with the flavorful and juicy chicken. The only negatives are when they run out of chicken and have to put new spits on the fire. This can lead to a 20 minute plus wait.
A few things come to mind when I think about eating here... Yum... The Best Ever!... and Yum (again). A few weeks ago while Jose and I were hanging out in DC he took me here and insisted that I try the best chicken in town. He was right.The dining room is very large, but they probably run out of room during the week as it was packed on Sunday. The chicken is very well seasoned, moist, and delicious. We ordered a whole chicken and I ended up taking some with me so I could snack on the way home (yes, I ate chicken on the drive back to Richmond).
After reading the "rave" reviews by Yelpers, I had to check out this place. I was definitely impressed by the parking lot full of cars.Typical fast-food style decor but in the back they had the gorgeous rotating chickens in brick ovens calling out to be consumed caveman-style. They had the Peruvian sauces, they were slightly different from Edy's a little thicker and more fresh. The chicken was moist and succulent and the skin had some more heat - I think it was the fresh ground pepper.Great chicken and will have to return!
A buddy dragged me across the Potomac where thar be dragons to try EPR. The place, and its government fire drill of a parking lot, reminds me of the many unpretentious Centroamericano restaurants in and around New Orleans. The good- Tender, juicy chicken that's well seasoned...I usually peel the skin off the chicken and leave it on the side, but the skin on this chicken is a delightful little appetizer to the flesh underneath it- Cole slaw with a hint of horseradish in it. Horseradish is magic.- Fast, efficient, multi-line serviceThe bad- No horchata...seriously? Even Chicken on the Run gets the canned horchata- The parking lot...almost as bad as the one outside Ray's the Steaks.- Something other than fries would be appreciated as a side...even yuca, of which I am not a fan.
If there's such a thing as crack chicken, this is the place. The long lines are proof of that. The skin is crispy and filled with spices, the insides are juicy and succulent. I can't think of any other way to prepare chicken any better. And it's one of the best bangs for the buck, a quarter chicken combo with fries and cole slaw is $5 including tax. But then it's so good, I can easily eat one of those whole chickens in one sitting.
I love the taste of this tender succulent Peruvian chicken place, esp/ when you pair the chicken w/ their homemade hot sauce. Even the coleslaw side taste pretty good since it cuts down the grease from the french fries. And it's such a great bargain! Love it!
They say that baristas try to make their coffee taste like it smells. Well, this chicken tastes like it smells. You step out of your car into the small parking lot (Be careful. Lots of cops. Don't double park.) and immediately smell that delicious, fire-y, roasted chicken skin-y smell wafting through the air. At this point, your mouth starts salivating.The storefront is unpretentious, as is the interior decoration, which is mainly lots of tables, a big countertop, the menu, and a few large generic Latin-themed posters on the wall. The wait isn't long, even at lunch when everyone within 10 blocks seems to be at Pollo Rico.And why are they all at Pollo Rico? Because the chicken is absolutely delicious. I don't care about the fries, which are fine, whatever, or the cole slaw, also fine. Whatever. The chicken! So good! There is also a decent selection of sodas and juices.1/4 chicken + fries + cole slaw = $4.49. You can get 1/4, 1/2, or a whole chicken ($14), take out or eat in. Why are you still reading this? Go get some chicken. Thank me later.
Found this place to be a bit overrated. Food was good, but not too special. Tender chicken, steak fries and some cole slaw. Food is cheap and plentiful which is a plus in this economy, but again, taste is nothing special. Parking was not a problem and no line or wait for food when I was there at about 8:30pm on a Monday night.
It does not get better than this. Well, for food anyway. The chicken is consistently delicious and tender, the fries and dipping sauces are drool-inducing, and the price is well worth the drive from DC. Ninety-five percent of the time I'm a vegetarian. The other five percent of the time I'm getting my fix at Pollo Rico. It's my vegetarian kryptonite.
When my vegetarian friend decided to go back on the meat again, this is where we went. He will never go veg again, recognizing the foolishness of a life without El Pollo Rico. Holy mother, this stuff is GOOD. And with regards to the sauces, get one extra of each and mix them all together.
Peruvian ChickenThat's it, that's all that you get on the menu, Peruvian Chicken.I must admit this is the first time I've had Peruvian Chicken, after being surrounded by so many rotisserie chicken places in my neighborhood in New York. How was it? It was very good!The menu is quite simple. You choose how large a piece of chicken you want, quarter, half, whole, and then you decide if you want steak fries and cole slaw with the order and that is it. For a minimum of about $5.50 or so, you can get a complete meal with drink. There are also dessert options on the menu, but you are here for the chicken, right?I expected the same flavors as the places I've had in New York, but their chicken meat tastes totally different. The spices and flavors used on the chicken really stand out and are really tasty. It is one of the best rotisserie chicken places I've eaten at. The meat isn't dry, but flavorful. They give you a spicy mayo and a chili pepper sauce which I really enjoyed. I used up all the chili pepper sauce on my chicken.A quarter order of chicken with sides and an Inca Cola (i'm not much of a fan of the cola, but you might be) makes a cheap lunch you can enjoy! A must come again!
This place is great!! I love it!! I go here often with my boyfriend who is latino...hes the one who got me hooked on it. Now I'm the one addicted to it! I wish they offered more sides but I still love the chicken and in my opinion, the french fries and coleslaw taste great. Inca Cola tastes good but I prefer Cola Champagne. There are other places in Arlington that serve Peruvian Chicken (I am a fan of Super Pollo too) but Pollo Rico is my #1 favorite. The only thing I wish they would do is add more sides to their menu.
I wanted El Pollo Rico to be my first, mainly because it felt like I had never eaten before until I went here. Such a young fickle life I had lead eating in Arlington only to find my true haven. Most weeks go a little something like this:Friday 5:16PMMe: I want PolloAnyone else I'm with: YES! PolloFriday 5:20PMMe: Sick, we're here, only 20 people in line, this should be quickFriday 5:22PMMe: Un cuarto para llavar con todos por favorFriday 5:23PMMe: This is amazing. Get it? Best Peruvian chicken around, slash, ever. I know some other places in Arlington give you choices for sides, and some people don't like cole slaw, but get over it, dip a few fries in there and enjoy it, mix some green into your yellow and love life.
I had been to at least 10 different chicken places until I found El Pollo 5 years ago. It is the best chicken I have ever had, and everyone I have introduced to it loves it.I work across the street, so I typically go 2-3 times a month. The one downside is that the chicken can be inconsistent, especially if you go after the lunch rush. However, even at it's worst (10\% of the time) and a bit overcooked, El Pollo is delicious.When it is mediocre (30\% of the time) it can compete with anything, and when it is at its best (60\% of the time) it is as good as anything I have ever eaten. I like the crappy steak fries and coleslaw (I mean that as a compliment), and you should always get 2 extra of both the hot and mild sauces to mix together and put on your chicken and fries.Really can't write enough good things about this place.
This place is ok. I've had better peruvian chicken in the area, so I won't rush back. I was disapointed to learn that they didn't do yuca fries, which are a big draw for me at these sorts of places. Checken was rpetty good and tender and the sauces were up to par but the limited sides were a big drawback.
The Carnie Crew hit El Pollo Rico with a fast, elite hunger force pursuing and engaging the kitchen with precision and hustle. The kitchen? Didn't stand a chance.This place was crowded, and the parking lot was inadequate to deal with the traffic. The kitchen was pretty quick with the enormous line, and the 1/4 chicken was a real good deal - the meat was really packed on. Sides are restricted to cole slaw and fries only, but there are several dessert options including flan, cake and milkshakes.My chicken was pretty good, but definitely on the dry side. Fries were decent, but nothing on my plate really impressed me.3 stars - Good deal and decent food. I didn't try the dessert options, but liked knowing I could jump on that train if so inclined. The restaurant is really crowded and parking is sort of a pain though. Happy Dining!
Brutus to Caesar. Iago to Othello. EPR is Super Pollo's "other half." The Yelp Carnivore Crew set out to settle the matter, once and for all, as to which restaurant's bird was cock of the walk. On the ride over, Monty commented on how slammed EPR's parking lot always is, and he wasn't joking. It's like the mall on Christmas Eve. Even at 2pm on a Saturday. If you're coming here from outside the neighborhood, do yourself a favor and take the Orange Line to Virginia Square. I got a quarter-dark chicken with cole slaw and fries (sides come with the meal, but all they have are fries and slaw). EPR's bird was bonier and not as juicy as Super Pollo's, but the skin and meat tasted much better in my opinion. Just the right amount of seasonings. Sides were pretty good, though nothing to write home about. They're kind of like the frame of the Mona Lisa... you're not going to the Louvre just for that. I decided to try Inca Cola while I was here. Seeing as how every other person at EPR was drinking it, I might as well do as the Romans do. I was expecting it to taste like, I dunno... cola. But it tasted like Big Red. Those of you from the South immediately know what I'm talking about: the rest of you need an explanation. Big Red is a soda popular in the South that tastes like (swear to God) bubble gum. Inca Cola tasted reminiscent of Big Red, but not nearly as nasty. The verdict: in the inevitable comparison vs. Super Pollo, I'd give the nod to EPR. The bird was a bit drier and bonier than Super Pollo's, but flavorwise tasted considerably better. Now as a public service, I'll give you my chicken roundup in order of preference: 1. Popeyes. Pros: crispy, spicy, skinly goodness. The sides more than hold their own (like mashed potatoes and sausage gravy). Cons: your plans later that night better involve being close to the commode. Very close. 2. Brigadier General Jason C.'s deep fat fried chicken. Pros: I grind up potato chips to use as batter. Hell yeah! Cons: unless you're a woman who's given me advance notice, my apartment is going to look like a shithole. Also, Chef Jason is most likely going to be in a t-shirt and underwear and have a few beers in him. 3. El Pollo Rico. Pros: Nicely seasoned and better sides than Super Pollo. Cons: chicken is about as bony as that guy who gets sand kicked in his face in those Charles Atlas advertisements. 4. Super Pollo. Pros: Juicy and tender chicken, plus you can get beer and wine if you want. Cons: Just didn't have that "oomph" flavorwise. 5. KFC. Pros: I dunno... oh wait! You have to be alive to get chicken from there. So if you get food there, you're not dead or anything. That's good! Cons: If you willingly go here over any other chicken joint, my opinion of you just went down a bit. And chances are that I don't even know you.
This assessment is from a comparative between Super Pollo and El Pollo Rico by the DC Yelp carnivore crew. We arrived to this establishment after having sampled Super Pollo's offerings.I was actually surprised to find that this place was a cash-only establishment. I thought those places went away with leaded gas. Fortunately another yelper stepped up and covered part of my bill.I found the chicken to be a bit bland. The skin was very crispy, but the meat was not seasoned well at all. It looked like all the seasoning (what little of it) was on the inside of the chicken and very little if any on or under the skin. Now, that may be something that is catering to most of their clientelle's tastes. I know a lot of my latino friends actually prefer what I could consider 'bland' foods. I like a nicely balanced seasoning that can enhance the flavor of the foods without overpowering it. And the green picante sauce was lacking in any flavor or heat. The sides that came with the chicken were steakfries and coleslaw. The coleslaw was average, though a bit runny. The steakfries were stale like they had sat too long under the warmers. Maybe it was because we came at around 3pm, but I found it disappointing overall. It is cheap eats, but you can get better fare for the same price. Of the two establishments, Super Pollo had the better fare than El Pollo Rico. But I think The Chicken Place in Bailey's Crossroads still has the best peruvian chicken in the area.
El Palin Rico.EPR was the 2nd stop for DC Yelp's Ms. Peruvian Chicken Universe World, with the other competitor being Ms. Super Pollo.Our panel of 10 judges from DC Yelp's Carnivore Crew have spoken: Super Pollo is better than El Pollo Rico.yelp.com/events/arlingtostatic.px.yelp.com/photoFood - so why did I rebrand this establishment as El Palin Rico? When I first laid eyes on her, I became that token Asian kid in American Pie, shouting, "MILF! MILF! MILF! MILF!" This was a unanimous sentiment for the entire Carnie Crew, as her firm, glistening skin accentuated her toned, tight thighs and breasts. But as we got to know El Palin more and more, we found that she had very little substance and from certain angles and lighting situations, she looked rather dude-likeyelp.com/events/washingtA 1/4 chicken is $4.59 ($0.24 cheaper than Super Pollo) and the 1/2 is $7.34 ($0.04 more than SP). It's served with 2 sides and 2 sides only: fries and cole slaw. Extra sauces are $0.20 each. The skin was crisp and tasty but the meat was similar to boiled chicken. Fall-off-the-bone tender is good for ribs, but nasty for chicken. I somehow managed to persevere through as I felt it my duty as a judge to completely vet this candidate, as it seems she was a poor choice to begin with.I heart sauce and as such, I forked over $0.40 to have an extra of each. The mayo sauce was comparable to SP, but the green chili sauce was incredibly bland - Monty C. didn't sweat at all. I never waste food, esp. food that I have to pay extra to obtain, but I left the extra green chili sauce completely behind. YUCCA!!!Is 2 stars fair? Well, you see, I had a former love who carried the same name:yelp.com/biz/super-chickand when I experienced this establishment carrying the same name, I felt like I was in some bizarre Korean drama.Location - Tiny parking lot in front but plenty of street parking (you need to pay meters on Saturday). The interior is MUCH nicer than the old EPR in Wheaton. We arrived around 2pm and the place was pretty busy. As aforementioned, $0.20 extra for sauce and you only get 1 of each sauce even with a 1/2 chicken. Muy LAMO senor!100+ reviews and 4.5 stars? Please, El Palin. I take your crown and throw it on the ground. The chicken is juicer, the sides are more plentiful, and they have cerveza at Super Pollo.\|    \| \\/ \\/ \\/ o o o  (That's supposed to be an upside-down crown)
It's pretty tough to review EPR without referencing nearby Super Pollo. After having Super Pollo, EPR just seems average. The ordering is much easier since all meals come with fries and slaw, but I'd rather have a choice of sides, and would definitely rather have yucca over the crappy freezer steak fries.Chicken skin was crispier, but it was definitely overcooked. Nowhere near as juicy as Super Pollo. The flavor is so much different at EPR. It doesn't have that deep, asian-influenced flavor of Super Pollo. You can tell the differences just by looking at the meat. The meat at EPR is bright white, with hardly any flavor in it.The food is cheap and quick, but with such better options in the area, I can't imagine any reason to come back here. If it were out in the middle of nowhere, I might give it 3 stars, but with choices of exceptional kabob restaurants and Super(ior) Pollo down the street, how could you possibly choose EPR for your chicken needs?
I often went to the El Pollo Rico in Wheaton, which is a lot closer to my work than this one, which I've been to once or twice. I think the Wheaton one is still closed due to a fire. Anyway, EPR is very inconsistent - I think depending on what time you come in - but when it's good it's *very* good. At worst you're going to get a super-dry piece of chicken that tastes like something from KFC with some spices dumped on it. At best, you'll say, "this is the best piece of chicken (peruvian or otherwise) I've ever tasted". It's not about the quality of the chicken itself, which is ordinary store-bought stuff and may even be subpar, but the marinade.The french fries are just ordinary frozen french fries - I'm seeing the reviews praising them and thinking hmm... they're what you get everywhere. Personally I'd rather see yucca (in Wheaton that is, I forget whether Arlington has it), since I don't have that as an option at every restaurant I go to. The coleslaw is, well, OK. I often get a piece of the rum cake, which, while it's an ordinary cake, is absolutely slathered in rum.It's impressive to see a restaurant that serves basically one thing only and is massively popular. Tells you that one thing is pretty darn good. Now if it could be a little more consistent... and serve yucca.
How do you know a restaurant is damn good? Number one, the owners are complete pricks who generally don't give a damn whether you eat there or not because they just know you'll come back. Check. My friends and I always order "to-go" and eat in the restaurant since the styrofoam to-go box generally holds larger quantities of El Pollo Rico's (EPR) delicious fries. The owner called us out on it one time and threatened to kick us out. Who cares? I also one time asked for 'Yucca' and the same guy just said, "Once again -- FRIES OR COLESLAW." OK, OK, keep your chinos on mo'fo, I'll be back next week.Two, if the restaurant is investigated by the federal government for money laundering and employing illegal aliens (ice.gov/pi/news/newsrele) and people are still filling the place. Check. This place is always packed with people happy to help EPR launder US currency. I don't care where the money came from; I just want my half chicken with fries and extra white sauce, thank you very much. You know the chicken has to be good if you're laundering money. Has to be.Three, if you serve some ethic food and people of the same ethnicity actually eat it, regularly. Check. Yes, Peruvians frequent this joint.
Best chicken in Maryland ever. Seasoned just right and made to perfection. occasionally chicken can be a bit dry; otherwise I'd give it 5 stars .
Though it's essentially the same as it's daddy in Maryland, I somehow like the original more. Maybe it's the cramped seating whereas this is so big and pristine and new. Ahh, anyway, if you live in VA this really is the only place you should be getting your pollo, unless you love Super Pollo's sides.
Best place for Peruvian chicken. Just check out the lines on any given day at lunch. Sure, you only have coleslaw and fries. And the fries are, no doubt, previously frozen, from a bag - but that's not why you go to El Pollo Rico. You go for the chicken. I don't even mind that there isn't yucca or other sides here, because the chicken is THAT GOOD. I don't even get the coleslaw. I don't ever eat coleslaw. So, I'm left with the fries and chicken - and I'm more than OK with that. The chicken has excellent flavor and isn't too salty like other Peruvian places. They also know exactly when the chicken is just right, in all it's juicy (never dry) goodness. Get some of that pepper sauce, which is better here than at any other place as well, and you're set. Some prefer the mayonnaise based sauce, but I pass on that. At my old job, the first question was always "What's for lunch?" All we had to say was CHICKEN, and everyone would know that meant El Pollo Rico.
Sure, the chicken was juicy and nicely seasoned. But come on, no yucca? And on top of that the skin wasn't nice and crispy. The white and green sauces were not up to par, as well. If EPR can crisp up the skin, improve their sauces and offer yucca, then they could be called the best in town. But until then, I'll just go to Edy's Chicken and Steak.
In the car, I felt like Toucan Sam, following my nose. Granted, there might have been some crossing smells with Super Pollo. The place looks almost like an autobody shop or a warehouse.The chicken is pretty good, very juicy, not too greasy. However, the flavor is less intense than at Super Pollo. When I ate my chicken at El Pollo Rico, I didn't taste chicken everytime I burped. This is a good thing. We'll see tomorrow if I wake up in withdrawal, but I don't think I'll be experiencing a crack-like effect. It's good chicken, but not kill my first born good. The cole slaw was ass. I don't think I saw a single person in the place eat their cole slaw. The fries were ok, but I would rather have me some yuca.The service was pretty good. The line moved through efficiently. 15 bucks for a whole chicken, cole slaw, and fries. Not bad. The parking lot was full, but there was plenty of street parking.My return will be dependent on which place (Super Pollo vs El Pollo Rico) I happen to be closer to.
BEST chicken place in town. Great sauces. I would definetly skip on the coleslaw. It would be a nice treat if they offered Yuca instead of the steak fries.
Everyone loves this place, a DC area icon.
My friend calls this Crack Chicken and he is right. I am addicted. The chicken is bursting with flavor. I have never been a fan of white meat because its dry, but no dryness here. The big steak fries are a perfect match with the pollo. My favorite thing, though, is the the mayo sauce for dunking of fries and chicken. Its not just mayo, there is something else to it. Whatever it is, its delicious. And wow is this place cheap! I can eat here for less than I can cook at home. It doesnt get much better!
Picked up a whole chicken to go from this place yesterday.  Don't let the lines worry you, as they move fast, and the workers are friendly and efficient. I counted 4 giant rotisserie's in the restaurant, so this place obviously sells a lot of birds. The ride home was torture, as the smell of the delicious chicken had my mouth watering!Once I dug in I could tell why this place is so popular. The flavor of the chicken is outstanding. Best Pollo ala Brassa I've ever had. Nice moist meat, smoky flavor, and great spice rub. The fries are okay, and the slaw kinda sucked, but who cares....the chicken is the selling point. Mixed the mayo and green sauces for a yummy dip, and I was in heaven.
Simply the best Peruvian chicken in the area. As others have noted, the sides are limited, but you go to a chicken place for the chicken, not the sides! Also known as 'crax,' because the chicken is so good that they must put crack in it. The nearby competitor, Super Pollo, has many sides, but the chicken, while decent, just doesn't measure up.
Greatest Peruvian Chicken Place of All Time!!!!! There's nothing else to say!
I used to eat here all the time before I left for college and although I didn't miss it too much while I was gone, I never forgot it. Now I am back and I am lovin' it all over again. Nothing has changed, the chicken is just as juicy and flavorful and the sauces are tasty as ever. I don't want to repeat what other people have said too much, but I will say that I have tried a variety of other Peruvian chicken places and I always come back to EPR. Super Pollo's green sauce is better/spicier, but their chicken is just not as good! The Chicken Place's chicken and sauces just do not make the cut. I've heard some good things about Pio Pio, but I will probably never go there because it is around the corner from EPR.I also enjoy that it is not as obnoxious looking as the other places. They are good and they know it!
This place is immensely popular and for good reason. The chicken has great flavor and the sauces are delicious. I recommend asking for white meat as sometimes the dark is a bit too fatty.
I can eat a whole, rotisserie chicken from this place. Not even kidding. It's just THAT good!!! Plus, I love that spicy, green sauce they give you with it (what IS that anyway?) and a side of fries... all for $12. Downside is, they only take cash.. so stop at an ATM on your way here.There's always been a line out the door whenever I've stopped in so be forewarned but it goes really fast and the people working are extremely friendly and nice which is RARE for any place around the DC area.
It's good, but I find the level of flavor varies.There's only been one time when the chicken was so finger-licking licious. Otherwise it was just tasty, but not enough to induce "Feed me, Seymour!!!" bouts of ravenous gorging.For equivalent above-average roast chicken taste, try Super Pollo down the road (next to that ghetto Ballston mall) for slightly lower price and to use your credit card.
Oh, El Pollo Rico. I have moved away from DC but I have to recommend this place to everyone. I know roasted chicken doesn't sound exciting to most people but this chicken is amazing. Every Monday I used to swing by El Pollo Rico and get chicken with fries. The sauces that come with the chicken are perfect for dipping the fries. I would mix them together and go town. It's a rare treat to find amazing food at super low prices and this joint has it in spades. I really think this place is a must for anyone in the DC area. There is nothing fancy about this place but that just makes it legit. Bring cash, that's all they take. The line can be out the door but they do a lot of take out and it usually moves pretty fast. Worth the wait.
If I had a million dollars, I'd buy in the new condo next to this place and eat it everyday. I love the chicken here, I don't know what they put in it, but it's working. As far as latin chicken goes, this place is king in the area. I highly recommend getting a whole chicken and eating it over a few days. They should offer yucca as an alternative to fries, but who cares, the chicken's great. Oh and if I had a million dollars, I wouldn't buy a million dollar condo next to a fast food chicken joint. I'd spend it all on pollo rico!!
Is it possible to give 6 stars? I have been going to this spot since coworkers introduced me to it back in 2003. The chicken is juicy and flavorful. Be sure to get the mayo and the spicy sauces. You might even want to ask for two of each. Mix the green one into the may before you dunk your chicken in it. This is a hands-only kind of spot, so be prepared to dig in like Fred Flintstone. The fries are nothing to scream about. After you have gorged on half a chicken, who needs fries? You best get there early if you are going for lunch during the week. The line gets long and the place fills up.
CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP... that's what I say... this place is sooo yummie good. Can't bet the price either.. We ordered the half chicken with steak fries.. love the mayo-mustard. My husband loved it so much he ate the left overs for 3 days straight. WOW... the place is great, friendly and just darn CHEAP EATS..
After dating my part-Peruvian boyfriend for almost five years, I have become fairly well-versed in pollo a la brasa, which I first came to know and love in New York (those of you who have had Pio Pio in Queens or Manhattan know what I mean!) El Pollo Rico was my first find in the DC/Arlington area, and initially I was impressed. However, after trying others, particularly the very nearby Super Pollo, this one is a little more hit-or-miss for me... although usually good, it sometimes comes out too dry. While I appreciate the simplicity of a limited 3-item menu, I don't always feel like the papas fritas, and I'm never a fan of their coleslaw. The parking is also much more of a headache at El Pollo Rico. Although I'll stop by there every once in a while to change it up, I usually regret it and wish I had just stuck with Super Pollo instead. To me, though, Peruvian chicken from almost anywhere beats the rotisserie chicken from a grocery store or "home cooking" chain like Boston Market or Chicken Out. It is my #1 standby meal when we have no time or no desire to cook. For a whole chicken and two sides at under $15, you can't beat it - a quick, easy, and inexpensive dinner for two, plus leftovers for lunch the next day (usually involving an arguement over who gets to have it). And at either place, I always pay a little bit extra for more green aji, which come in tiiiiny little cups but I combine into a larger container at home to save and use with other meals.BEWARE if you are carrying out - your car will smell for days. And smelling it will make you hungry for more.
El Pollo Rico was a staple of my diet when I lived in Arlington and I really miss being able stop by on my way home. It's the best Peruvian chicken around. I've been to all the other Peruvian chicken places in the DC area like Crisp & Juicy and Super Pollo, but the chicken does not compare. The others may have a wider variety of side (your choices at EPR are fries and cole slaw, both of which are delicious), but the chicken keeps me from straying from EPR.A couple of years ago, we were waiting in line at night. We were probably 40 people back in line (expect long lines, but they move pretty quickly). Within a few minutes, we'd moved up about 10 spots in line, and another 10 or 15 came in behind us. We found out that they had a fire in a couple of their ovens, so only half of them were working. Right then, they tell us that they are out of chicken and that it will be another 20-25 minutes before the next batch. Now normally if you are at a fast food place and they tell you it's going to be at least 20-25 minutes before the next batch of food comes out, you turn around and go find another fast food place. But that night, I looked at the people in front of us and behind us, and not a single person left. We all waited an extra 25 minutes to get our delicious El Pollo Rico chicken. That alone should tell you how good this place is.
I might as well write review nr. 80! To me, El Pollo Rico is a quintessential DC place...good food, great prices, and as diverse a clientele as you'll see anywhere. I don't get here often enough, but when I do, I enjoy it greatly. Parking can be hassle, but if you don't even bother trying to squeeze into the lot in front, and just find some street parking, you'll be fine.
I never knew the true awesomeness of chicken until I had El Pollo Rico. Who knew a rotisserie chicken can taste soooo goood! El Pollo Rico is the best place for fast and cheap food. The portions are enough to fill you and make you feel like a fat-ass. Oooh and that sauce! Mmmm! That sauce! I don't what it is but I know it's damn tasty! Make sure to ask for extra! The chicken is already good as it is but the sauce just takes it to another dimension! The steak fries are pretty standard but still tasty as all hell, especially with the sauce! More sauce!! The lines get really long but seem to move pretty fast. What makes waiting in line even more of a pain is having to stand there drooling as you stare at the chickens ever-so-gently roasting away in the distance dripping their juiciness. The only reason why I'm not giving this place a 5-star rating is because it's in VA and not DC. Boo!
Meh. For $5 you get a leg-and-thigh of tasty rotisserie chicken and a double handful of decent steak fries. (It's $7-8 for a 1/2 chicken). Your belly will be super full of starch & protein. The green chili sauce is excellent but the yellow sauce is flavored mayo. Cash only. If I could get white meat only epr would get 4 stars. They have desserts that I might one day try (carrot cake? awesome), inka cola and other drinks.Staff are friendly and fast, at lunch time they have like 20 chickens roasting so you can be in and out in 3-4 mins with very fresh food. It's bigger than it looks from the outside so even though it's wicked crowded you can find a table. I recommend it. If this is your lunch break be forewarned that it's a bit messy to be eating at your desk/computer while pretending to work. Parking seems ridiculous. There are always cars waiting to get into the lot, which is odd since there's usually street parking 2 blocks away.
I just posted a review for Ravi Kabob (also in Arlington), and realised that I had to do justice by posting a review for another fine weekday lunch haunt - El Pollo Rico. However, EPR is much more of a Washington establishment than Ravi Kabob will ever be. Just pick up a copy of Zagat and you'll how famous this joint already is.The place basically looks like a warehouse with some doors on the side of a small car park. You walk in, join the queue, tell the guy with the butcher's knife what size portion you want, ask for extra stuff, pay, seat yourself, enjoy. Feel content. Get back to the office. Feel fat.There's a reason for hype behind El Pollo Rico's famed Peruvian rotisserie chicken. It's just really really yummy. The meat is so wonderfully juicy and the skin has the perfect degree of crispiness. The seasoning is slightly spicy, but not enough to upset the stomach of my mildest eating colleague. There are two sauces though - a green hot sauce and a thick white creamy sauce. I forgot what they are, but they were both delicious with the chicken.I'm going to dock a star for a few reasons. (1) The sides were nothing special. (2) If you let the chicken sit a while, it will drip a puddle. (3) I'm pretty sure it has crack in it. Not good for healthy living.Hell I'll give it back the star. Why? Because writing this review has made me salivate like Pavlov's dog.
An Arlington institution! There are tons of peruvian chicken places in the area, but no where is it served, hotter, fresher or better spiced than at Pollo Rico. Everyone eats here - white collar, blue collar no collar; black brown and white. It's a better vision of humanity trough rotisserie chicken and unyeilding deliciousness it what is on the menu. I do miss the old location in the run down strip mall, but their new spot on Kenmore is nice, bright and clean. Parking is tight though, so walk if you're able. Just like the old joint, there are generally two lines running so even if the queue snakes up to the door the wait is very short. You're real trouble might be finding a place to sit, but by in large even if it looks hopeless when you enter you'll probably find a spot by the time you are ready to sit. Showing up with a big group at the high tides of lunch and dinner is probably not your best bet. The menu is simple - white or dark meat - quarter half or whole. Fries, slaw or both on the side. There are other dessert odds and ends but nothing essential, although the afajores cookies can be really good. The chicken is always cooking and the fires are always fresh. The slaw is hardly homemade but I'd be willing to bathe in the bucket they scoop it out of - so good! My only big gripe is the cut-rate ketchup. It just doesn't measure up - thin, syrupy and lame. Cross Wilson Blvd for Carvel softserve if you've still got room left when you're done!
I've only been to this restaurant twice, but I will definitely return again and again. El Pollo Rico is surely a guilty pleasure since their chicken and sides are kind of greasy, but who's gonna live forever. Just make sure you have plenty of cash on hand because they don't take plastic. Also, good luck on locating a place to park.
An all time favorrite - you can never go wrong with Peruvian chicken with a side of fires and slaw... yum!
It took FOREVER to get the food, and when we did, my girlfriend and I have been sick for four days now with diarrhea, throwing-up, and an overall sickly feeling. I will never eat here again. If you look up their restaurant on google, you can see all of the violations the health department has given them. I have never had diarrhea like this and will have to go to the doctor and utilize my health insurance due to their contaminated environment. DONT eat here if you dont want to get sick! The place is dirty. Look at it once you walk in!
I have been eating El Pollo since the 80's. It was the first Peruvian chicken I ever ate which is completely unfair to every other place I have eaten at since. Nothing compares.They lose one star for having half their family arrested by the feds.
I never thought rotisserie chicken could be so juicy-greasy-delectable but entirely not of the I'm-going-to-feel-sick-later variety until I happened upon EPR. If the side dishes were better, this place would warrant five stars. Chunky steak fries were crispy with oil and cole slaw had a sweetness to the dressing that I liked. Neither was mind-blowing, but each complimented the poultry well. The alfajores--buttery cookies with dulce de leche sandwiched in between and an ample dusting of powdered sugar on top--were to die for.I liked how the dining room--which was much more spacious than I had expected before showing up--was full of satisfied chicken-eaters spanning every race, age group, and, presumably, socioeconomic background in the DC area. And to the immensely generous gentleman in line behind us, who realized my sig-o and I were short $2, thrust a couple of dollar bills into the cashier's hand, and wouldn't take no for an answer, how can we make it up to you?"That's what friends are for," said the cashier. In any case, I'll be back soon.
This Peruvian chicken place is hands down my favorite place to eat in my neighborhood. What I love about El Pollo Rico is it does one thing really well and just sticks to that, which is making awesome chicken. If you're looking for low-carb sandwich wraps, take it elsewhere. Even though they raised their prices, the chicken platter with french fries and coleslaw is still a good deal. And to top it off they sell Inca Cola, which is a must with every meal.
DAMN. GOOD. CHICKEN. Go here, you will not be disappointed. They put something in the spices that keeps you coming back for more. I'm not saying it's illegal, but it's definitely addicting.
The 1/4 white chicken was great. Crisp on the outside, tender and juicy on the inside and very flavorful. To make this even better, they had the 2 usual sauces... wow... what more can you say. The cole slaw and steak fries (included) were good... nothing to complain about. To finalize the deal, this meal costs $5 including tax. Great food at a great price... I have also tried Super Pollo, and think that the chicken here is better as it is more crispy on the outside of the chicken... both places have good chicken but El Pollo Rico is a tad better (chicken-wise).
Holy crap...so. good.If it was between eating in one of the 100s of different kinds of restaurants in Berkeley by my apt or traveling by any means possible to VA for Peruvian chicken here, it would be EPR hands down. The chicken.. ever so juicy and tender, effortlessly falling off the bones into my gluttonous west coast mouthCorn on the cob.. so flavorful and a perfect mate to my chickenCole slaw.. the perfect tartness and bite to refresh your palateFries...how can you mess up friesThe price... is this for real? Leaves you enough $ to come back for thirds.
Ridiculously delicious. Greasy, salty, chard and juicy, all four bbq food groups are well represented here. Its kind of hard to imagine the humble chicken being even this good, let alone any better. I found that the sauces when combined are far more than the sum of their parts.I'm docking a star for lack of side items though. Maybe this is so they can concentrate solely on their chicken, but some fried yucca or plantains wouldn't hurt.
It's hard to rate this establishment for the simple reason that while eating the chicken, cole slaw, and fries you think it's amazing but then when you're done you feel like the ghosts of all the chicken that have ever been consumed at Pollo Rico collectively took a dump on your soul.As you can tell, I rated the place once I was done eating.Addendum: Who am I kidding? I can't stop eating here. The high I get while eating Pollo Rico will always haunt my dreams.
Oh yes, the famous "chico chicken" as we used to call it. Let me assure you - this is the best rotessierie chicken out there. Quite positively the only place I could eat lunch at 5 days a week, and I have never cared for chicken! Every time I travel back to DC, I always make a stop here...
I moved away from DC 9 years ago, and I still try to get here every time I'm in the area. I keenly miss the crisped and subtly spiced chicken and the sauces that come with the fries. Simple, direct, perfect.Would that San Francisco had chicken as good.
While I don't get El Pollo Rico as much I'd like (and my body probably thanks me for that), I will say that between me and my roommate, "the delicious chicken place" and our intense cravings for it come up in conversation at least five nights a week.You don't get the choice of sides like at Super Pollo though; EPR only has coleslaw and steak fries. The coleslaw has too much mayo. The fries, while definitely of the frozen variety, are tasty, especially when slathered in that mild mayo sauce. What is that sauce anyway? And who knew something so lime green in color could be so delicious?But the chicken is the best part, of course, and is way better than Super Pollo. It's greasy, messy and absolutely amazing. Have lots of napkins ready and don't expect to impress a date after he or she watches you devour every scrap of chicken straight off the bone and then lick your fingers... but a date will be impressed with your knowledge of this inconspicious little gem, so it's a toss up. Actually, scratch that - any decent date would be too busy doing the same to notice your sloppy habits, so go for it.Cash only, and they definitely run out of chicken so don't get there too close to 10pm. They ran out today at prime dinner time, but I didn't see a single person get out of the long line while waiting for a new batch. EPR is definitely worth a wait.
It's good, but it ain't Super Pollo. I am convinced that those of you who gave this place 5 stars have not gone to Super Pollo (which, btw, is about 3 blocks away). While the chicken at EPR is moist and the spices pretty good, it's just not AS good as Super Pollo. And EPR's limited selection of sides (no chick peas??) - basically cole slaw and fries - lost them more points. AND EPR doesn't have tv's playing spanish channels, which makes the experience just lackluster.
Wow, the chicken here is absolutely great. I don't think I've ever had better chicken.However, I have to give this place 4 stars instead of 5 because they don't have yucca fries. Just french fries. For shame.
There are restaurants which want to serve everything, but do it is medico for everything it serves. But this one is the opposite, it does only one thing, and it does it very well. I am not a big fan of chicken (I prefer more veggie dishes), but I just couldn't resist the temptation to try it. First I was turned away because they did NOT take plastic, but I was determined to try it, so I got some cash with the ATM location from the owner and started my adventure. The chicken was good, very tender and well-spiced. I got a half chicken, which would allow me to do try both the white meat and dark meat. I tend to like dark meat better when it comes to chicken, and they definitely did a very good job. The white meat was very tender as well, though I still think if you want to get 1/4 chicken, you should probably go for dark meat.The fries were decent and the cole slaw, well, just cole slaw. The sides were limited, but I think the main attraction here is definitely just the chicken. After a half chicken, some fries and cole slaw, I finally got stuffed enough to walk out with satisfaction. I have not had charcoal chicken a lot, but this is definitely one of the best ones I had. The place was clean and the price affordable. The food was pretty good. I probably will not come back on a regular basis even if I live here (come on, you can't live on charcoal chicken), but I would certainly come back periodically if I were to live in the area.
When I come to a new town/city, I want to try food anywhere from hole-in-the-walls to gourmet places. I rated this place for what it is, a hole-in-the-wall joint, but a hole-in-the-wall that has pretty good chicken. The chicken was really moist and tasty due to all the spices on it. Everything else was passable. You get a decent meal for your money. Would be closer to 3 1/2 stars, I just rounded up.
The boy started describing El Pollo Rico to my friend who traveled around Peru for three months and they both started drooling, even foaming at the mouth. Having heard stories about Peru from said friend (one extreme story involved being deep in the Amazon and eating rat) I wasn't hopeful about Peruvian chicken, but I can't say no to two droolers. We rolled into El Pollo Rico at the right time - just before 1pm on a weekday - which proved to be perfect as while we were eating the line began to grow and stretch out the door at one point. Serious chicken, indeed.We each ordered the 1/4 chicken ($4.10), which comes with a side of coleslaw, steak fries and two sauces. My friend had literally not sat down before he was tearing into his chicken. He gave it a thumbs up for Peruvian chicken, not 100\% authentic, but still delicious. "In Peru, the chicken comes with thick fries like these and you just smother it in Peruvian mayonaise," he explained. The chicken is incredibly moist, flavorful and the mayo dipping sauce is probably not good for my health, but boy did I want three more containers of it. By the end of the meal I was dipping practically anything and everything in it indiscriminately. Chicken and fries, I wonder if you don't rival chicken and waffles...The service is efficient, the food is cheap and excellent, and I'm sure I'll be back to El Pollo Rico many more times in the future. The boy readily adopted the "El Pollo Rico is like crack... in chicken form" slogan as his excuse to visit again and again.
Crack cocaine, shaped like a chicken. Five stars.
I guess you either love this place, or not, but I love it. The chicken is moist and flavorful. I request the white meat because it is as juicy as dark meat at other places, and the dark meat here is a little too moist for my liking.The fries are not great, they have no Yucca which is a staple at other places and you have to walk up and grab a hand full of off brand ketchup packages if you want that on your fries, but the chicken is superb.I've tried many places in the metro area including Eddy's in Bailey's and El Pollo Saboroso in Mt Pleasant, but El Pollo Rico remains my favorite.  I was sad to see it move, since Eddy's chicken went down hill when they moved, but the new place is just as good and the AC actually works, which is nice with those coal ovens running all day.
I don't know why so many people rave about this place. I went there after being told how great it was, only to pay $7 for some greasy chicken that might as well have been from under the heat lamp at Giant, some terrible fries and some Inca cola that I couldn't even finish. If you're not already completely in love with crappy Latin American rotisserie chicken, skip this dump.
I was also disappointed by Pollo Rico. You'd think by the way people talk about it (and line up) that it's liquid gold or at least cooked in crack. But I don't get it (and I LOVE Latin rotisserie chicken). Pio Pio just around the corner has better spices, better prices, same sauces, and there is no wait. The one thing I will give Pollo Rico is that their fries are good.*Later edit* Since writing this the first time, Pio Pio has changed chefs and quality has declined to the dangerous! level. I now recommend "That Chicken Place" off Rte 7 in Bailey's Crossroad, or Edy's Chicken & Steak in the same general area.
This place would get five stars, except for the sides.The chicken at this place is very good and juicy. They are flame roasted on a rotisserie...if you go into the store you see about 49 million chickens on rotisseries. Anyway, the rub on the chicken is soooooooooooooooooo yummy. Its spicy yet sweet and savory. It is the best. Your chicken also comes with two small containers (very small) of sauces - a yellow mayo looking sauce (although it is definitely not mayo) and a green salsa looking creation that looks and tastes to be made of ground up/chopped green chilies. You might want to ask for an extra sauce or two. I mix the two sauces *together* in their containers before dipping in my chicken. You should do the same!Anyway, the sides SUCK. Big time!! The chicken comes with a side of fries and a side of cole slaw. The cole slaw is gross. It is so full of mayo, but in a very bad way (I like mayo but there is hardly any cabbage in it - id say like 75 percent mayo, 25 percent cabbage). The flavor of the slaw stinks as well. The fries are the better of the two but they stink too, just not as much as the slaw. They pretty much come out of a freezer bag full of fries, and they just are so boring yaaaaaaaawn. For better sides, I suggest you go to Super Pollo, which is also in the area. They have good sides. Also, this place is cash only. So leave your check cards at home!
Oh SNAP! This place reminded me of Pollos a la Brasa in downtown L.A., which is the best Peruvian chicken I've ever had. We went for lunch on a Friday and arrived around 11:15am. It was perfect timing; no one was in line yet and we were able to order and sit down right away.We all got the 1/4 chicken, cole slaw and fries. I'm not a big fries person (only like the fries from In-N-Out), but these steak fries were just right. A slight crisp on the outside, with a perfect softness inside. I ate the majority of my fries, but I'm not a coleslaw person. I had a few bites and thought it was ok. Now lets get down to the chicken. The marinade has just the right amount of spice and the chicken is so incredibly tender. The food was hot like we just got it off the spit, and fell apart in my hands from the tenderness. The skin was incredible, the chicken was perfectly flavored from the marinade...can't say enough.Also be sure to get the Inka cola! All in all, a perfect meal for a cheap price. You will leave completely satisfied and know your money just bought a little bit of heaven!
All I can say is DITTO to all the other reviews. We've been getting El Pollo Rico since I moved to DC and have to say it's not only the best bang for your buck, but it's the tastiest bird in town!
Best Peruvian chicken in the Northern Virginia area--it trumps Super Pollo, Crisp 'n Juicy, and Pollo Campero. The chicken is sublimely juicy and covered in delectably spiced skin, giving off its enticing aroma for about a three-block radius. My crowning achievement is having eaten a half chicken with yucca and cole slaw by myself after three hours of pickup ultimate.EDIT (5/2/08): I apparently hallucinated the yucca. Super Pollo has the yucca.
Excellent peruvian chicken. Tasty, quick, cheap.
Overall, disappointing. Visited right during dinner time on a weeknight for the freshest chicken experience possible. I was expecting something amazing, since yelpers seem to be all about this place. But the chicken and lack of variety of sides simply can't compare to those of it's nearby rival, Super Pollo.The chicken, while very fresh, was simply bland tasting. Not as greasy and juicy as Super Pollo and definitely lacking in flavor. And don't even get me started on the sides!!! I can deal with only 2 sides... IF one is yucca. Nope, all you get here is some coleslaw with tons of mayo (yech) and some tasteless FRIES. Where is the YUCCA?! You can't call this Peruvian chicken without the Yucca...sorry.I also had to wonder about the sauces - the spicy green and the yellow mayo mix sauces. They must have a separate stash of the 'spicy' stuff for "gringos" and the real authentic spicy stuff for the Hispanics. The sauce was NOT hot at all...bleh. depressing..... The flan was tasty enough though.I've been eating Peruvian chicken in the area for the past 20 years, so trust me, this place isn't as authentic as you can get. It is absolutely better than any supermarket prepared bird or the sorry excuses for chicken at fast food joints like kfc but please, please, please...DON"T try and say this is real Peruvian chicken....check out Super Pollo for tastier chicken and a wonderful assortment of sides! (yes, yucca and that huge kernel Peruvian 'corn'). mmm!P.S. cash only here
This is, unquestionably, the best chicken I've ever had. It is one of the few things I miss about living in Arlington. Man, I might need to take a road trip soon to get some more.
Whats that? You're starving? And you only have $5 in your pocket? No problem, drive over to El Pollo Rico and buy a quarter chicken with fries and cole slaw for $5!! This is the best, and I mean Best rotisserie chicken in the entire DC metro region - its probably better than the ones in New York! Definitely a carnivore's haven, where you can easily buy two people a huge meal for under $10. My secret for enjoying the chicken is in the sauces that come with the meat. You get a choice of white/mild sauce and green/chilli sauce - but get both and mix them up together for a fan-freakin-tastic dipping sauce for your chicken. The extra sauce is just 10 cents, and I usually buy 4 of them because they're sooo amazing.Update: November 2008I must rescind any remarks I might have foolishly made on the quality of meat served out from this mass-chicken producer. Eat At Your Own Peril - Chicken Contains Hazardous Material That Will Send You To The Hospital .
With my vegetarian girlfriend out of town for a few days, I called up some carnivore buddies and headed over to this holy shrine of rotisserie chicken... the lines can run out the door, but the wait is worth it and the place lives up to the high praise. located in a strange, nondescript white building not far from George Mason law school, it can be accessed by metro (get off at Virginia Square and walk a few blocks east), or by car-- but be forewarned that the parking lot can be a mess at dinner time, with lots of customers arriving to pick up a take-out order. the half-chicken order was too much for me to eat, along with the fries and cole slaw; next time I'll just get a quarter chicken so my friends wouldn't have to roll my body out of the place.
great chicken and steak fries!the mayo based sauce is the best, you'll love it on the chicken and the fries. No matter which location - the workers are ALWAYS friendly.hmmmm...might need to make that a treat this weekend *smile*
Just got back from El Pollo Rico. It was awesome.My wife and I are from the Chicago area and we looked on Yelp while in DC. After having Meskerem (Ethiopian in Adams-Morgan neighborhood) and reading about that here, we also noticed that El Pollo Rico was rated so highly. So across the Potomac we go - after our touristy stuff was over. First of all we were expecting a large sign or some sort of fanfare since it was so highly rated. When we pulled up to the site, we weren't sure it was the right place. It is very nondescript. There is a small sign and we walked in. You could smell the place from the parking lot as the aromatic smoke was rising through a chimney. So we ordered the broiled lamb with mint and the Bow-tie Pasta. Just kidding. The only thing you can order is pollo (chicken). It was awesome. You get fresh fries with that and we just HAD to get the Peruvian Inca Cola (Wikipedia if interested). I usually like dark meat and skin because it is juicy and flavorful. My wife usually likes the breast meat and not the skin. Well, both of us ate everything. She ate the skin and dark meat, I ate the breast meat (which was actually juicy!!!).The pollo came with two sauces. One seemed a mayonnaise/mustard combo and the other was a coriander(cilantro)/hot chilies combo which reminded me of the coriander chutney found in Indian restaurants.I used the cilantro/chilies sauce for the pollo and the mayonnaise/mustard sauce for the steak fries. By the way, the steak fries were equally great. they were thick and freshly fried, hot and perfectly salted. With the mayo/mustard sauce, it was outstanding.We had the flan for dessert and it was good but bland. I usually have (and prefer) a stronger flan but the bland might be more authentic..I don't know. It was very good though.The pollo had a strong cumin flavor and was roasted over a fire (which you can see while you are ordering). It looks great, tastes great, and was an excellent choice.Thanks to all of you Yelpers out there for pointing us to an awesome place in your town.DC is a great place and I noticed two things: A truly international dining city and a lot of joggers. I could see if the two were connected. If I lived here I probably would wind up like the guy they had to bury in a coffin the size of a grand piano because of all the awesome food you have here. Great town, great food. Enjoy DCers, you are lucky.
Not to rain on your parade, but I went after reading all the rave reviews and I really think you guys are hyping it up too much. Yes, it was better than Boston Market. But is that really saying much?Maybe I just don't get this whole Peruvian chicken fixation. Yes, its cooked with some herbs. Ok. But almost all of the flavor was on the skin, which was so thick and greasy that I seriously questioned eating it. It is very affordable, I'll give you that, and the people who work there seem nice. When I have a craving for greasy chicken, I'll probably stick with Popeye's.
This place is good, but IMHO not as good as Super Chicken. I like having options when it comes to sides, not just fries and slaw. And I agree with the last review, a bit salty, but so is super chicken.
Like Caribbean Grill, this place has excellent chicken. The fries are pretty good, but there aren't any other side choices. The parking lot is really small and it's usually a bit of a challenge to find a spot around prime eating times.
Greatest! Fries were fresh! Chicken is tasty!!!
fast, cheap and pretty good chicken. wouldn't have gone without all the reviews so thanks to all.
I think friends of mine overhyped it way too much and it ruined my first experience there. Good food and that green sauce is great but definitely somewhat overhyped.
Have been loving this place for over 8 yrs now and still wished I could go more often. Great price, excellent chicken and fries, gotta have the green sauce mixed with the mayo for both the chicken and the fries...we always pay more for extra green sauce :-P !!!!!The aroma of the chicken is enough to drive you insane!!! YUM!
This place get 5 stars based on the chicken alone. The chicken is excellent, and if you get there earlier in the day, they come fresh off the rotisserie, steaming hot and ridiculously good. Every order comes with a side of fries, coleslaw and two sauces. Coleslaw? Forgettable. Fries: Generic. Sauces? Get extra! The chicken, as delicious and delectable as it is on its own, is made stratospheric eaten with the sauces. I cannot decide which I like better, though I lean towards the green because I likes me spice. The fries are also greatly improved by being dipped in the sauce, which is why it's imperative you get extra sauce.
This place is an "old faithful" or Arlington. The food is consistently good, and always the same. I marginally prefer it over super pollo, but a large part of that is due to its location and the simple fact that their fries are better.
It's all been said before. Just go and try it for yourself. I feel like I'm doing some kind of good everytime I introduce a friend to the deliciousness that is El Pollo Rico. Last time I went here, a fellow customer joked that he would totally rob the store of their roasted chicken (still spinning on the spit) and leave the cash untouched. Amazing chicken has that effect on you.To fully enjoy the EPR experience, you MUST use your hands and order extra sauce.
yummy! el pollo rico gives me a reason to think that my love handles are just fine where they are.
I can't believe that I worked in Arlington for 5 years before going to Pollo Rico. Their chicken is easily the best that I've ever had! All they serve is chicken, fries, and sauerkraut. Try a quarter or half chicken for your first time. The meat is so moist and juicy - I don't know how they do it.I've now made Pollo Rico one of my regular joints for cheap, delicious meals.
The 'Rico is the stuff that dreams are made of. As you pull in to the tiny, decrepit parking lot the aroma hits you and you know that the drive was worth it. As you walk through the doors, you notice the Zagat sticker on the door is in complete contradiction to the rest of the decor. Even though the line is 15 people long, you're ordering in less than 5 minutes. You're ready to order because hey, you've only got 4 options, and all they involve is various sizes of rotisserie chicken. You ask for extra sauce and hand the cashier a 5-spot, because that's all you need. You take your seat among the diverse crowd of construction workers, yuppies, families, and college kids and enjoy the splendor that is El Pollo Rico. You usually first come to the 'Rico because you hear how incredibly cheap it is, but you keep coming back because its so damn good. Every person that I have taken comes in a complete disbeliever but leaves an addict.
My 1st Yelp review. How exciting. I'm really nervous. *Two deep breaths* OK Go!What else can I say. I can eat here at least 4x a week. The chix is that good. What makes it stand out from the rest ie. Boston Market, your local grocery store, Chicken Out Rotisserie is the fact that it comes out moist evenly with the rub and spices, it's absolutely perfect! There is only two options for sides (coleslaw from Costco or the crisp but sometimes soggy fries). Along with the Mayo-Mustardy concoction sauce that they give, which to me is like crack-cocaine, its that addicting. I wish they sold jars of this stuff at the grocery store..lol. I always take it to-go, but they have plenty of seating. It would be great if they opened later since they close up around 10PM. If you speak Spanish with whomever is the cashier, they may throw in some extra sauce at no extra charge. At least it works for me! Check this place out, you won't be disappointed. Parking can suck during the lunch rush. Watch out for the damn Arlington PD..they're always ready to nail you with a ticket around there if you park illegally.
Sorry folks I have to say Peruvian Chicken is overrated. I've eaten at El Pollo Rico two or three times. I didn't find the marinade particularly flavorful and I remember my pieces of chicken to be bony. The green sauce and the mayo sauce rescue the meat from being bland.For chicken made rotisserie style, I personally like seasoning with thyme and other herbs. None of that can be tasted here. (Best rotisserie chicken I've had was at some random restaurant in Russian Hill, SF a long time ago.)For about the same money, I'd rather get my chicken at Kebab Palace down in Crystal City. Yes, Inka Cola is liquid bubble gum!
I was lucky enough to find this place on Yelp and on several recommendations I decided to check it out while I was in D.C. this past weeked. I'd never had Peruvian chicken before so I was anxious to try it out. My g/f and I ordered a whole chicken + a side of coleslaw and fries with two drinks for $15. I was starving at the time so I ended up eating 3/4 of the chicken as my g/f was full after a 1/4. If I were to go there again I would order a half chicken + sides but make sure to order white meat only. The dark side of the bird has less meat and more gristle while the white side had tons of meat and really made the meal. The yellow sauce & green spice are meant to be mixed together in case you are wondering. I was thoroughly satisifed with the meal and also enjoyed the "Rio Grande" Champagne Soda. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a different meal close to D.C.
What's the best thing this place is known for? Chicken (the Peruvian rotisserie kind). What's the main dish they have here. Chicken (the Peruvian rotisserie kind). What is by far the best kind of food around? Chicken (the Peruvian kind of course). Because of you Yelpers, I couldn't help but make my fiance drive me from my cushy home near Tyson's Corner to the dark and somewhat sketchy Arlington neighborhood in search a gem hidden along a dark road lit up only by a small yellow sign. It might look dark and sketchy on the outside, but once inside you're greeted with bright fluorescent lights bouncing off the colorfully-painted walls. Cleaner and more sterile than other Peruvian places I've been to, but that makes it all better.I agree with the rest of you guys - the chicken is by far the most flavorful I've ever had. Well seasoned, salty skin adds to the succulent chicken experience.  Unfortunately the meat was drier than The Chicken Place so this place lost a star there. The sauces were good, but they were pasty and not as saucy as other places. Definitely good chicken I'd come back to if I'm in the area or if I can drag someone out there with me :-)
There's Rico Suave, Puerto Rico, and even the Rico (Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations) Act, but none of those can beat El Pollo Rico when it comes to Peruvian chicken. This place makes me say, "Si, Si, Siii! Por favor, yo lo quiero!" and other things Espanol which I've long forgotten since my days of high school Spanish class and the bad commercials of a few years ago starring a chihuahua. I won't even bother to mention the eating establishment because that fast food chain does not deserve to be uttered in the same review with EPR.\Without the rave reviews and amazing aromas, I could have easily missed out on this clucking good food - I would have been one clucked foodie. Thanks to Yelp, though, I haven't been left out in the cold. I picked up a whole chicken, with sides of fries and coleslaw, for a whopping total of merely $12.75. A WHOLE entire chicken! That easily fed both me and my big, hungry man. And I haven't even started to talk about the delicious garlic aioli and spicy sauces that come with the meal. \I'm ashamed to admit that I used to think the Costco rotisserie chicken was decent. Please don't view that last sentence as a measure of my judgment of the pollo! I know better now. Some on Yelp have argued that Super Pollo down the street is just as good or even better than EPR. There's a whole talk string discussing the various points. SP has more side dishes. But as far as the chicken itself is concerned? I *might* have to agree that El Pollo Rico rules. But to be sure, I'll have to conduct many, many taste tests between the two restaurants. It's a tough job, but someone has to do it.\In the meantime, I will practice my Spanish and say GRACIAS to El Pollo Rico for their chicken. I feel much more rico after discovering you (or, I guess ricA since I'm female - see, I did learn in Spanish class)!
Truly excellent chicken -that can't be beat- and the fries and coleslaw are good...but that is the whole menu. If you want yuca or rice and beans, you need to eat elsewhere. Also...I don't like the brand of ketchup packets they use...but I still cover my fries in it.
The best Peruvian chicken around in my opinion.
I fondly remember my first El Pollo Rico experience. It occured a few days after moving to Arlington, and I didn't even eat there that night.\It was the old Clarendon location (BECF - before evil cheesecake factory) near Washington Blvd.  At the stop light at Washington and 10th, I saw the smoke and smelled the most delightful air pollution ever. It was the smell of seriously yummy smelling chicken. Sadly however, I had to get home, so I went home hungry.\The next night, I pulled up to the intersection of Washington Blvd and 10th street once again. I rolled down my window and took in the chicken smell as I had the night before. I didn't know the name or address of the place, I didn't ask for directions. I simply used my nose to find my way to what I found out was El Pollo Rico.  \I waited in a line that was easily 25 people deep. I ordered a 1/4 chicken, fries, slaw, mayo/green chili sauce and of course, a can of Inca Kola. I found a table, sat and ate. It was perfect.\Since then , I have ventured out to try other Peruvian style chicken joints. I still love theirs best. Their menu is so simple that it's easy to do everything well. Their chicken is spiced perfectly, the skin crispy and the meat juicy. Some come very close, but El Pollo Rico is the best in my opinion.
I don't really understand how this works, but you can get chicken here for less than you can buy the equivalent amount of raw, packaged chicken in a grocery store. Fine, you caught me: that is an exaggeration-- but only a small one. This place makes rotisserie, Peruvian-style chicken. This means that it is dry-rubbed with various spices (I detected a lot of cumin) and rotated on a spit for a long time. It's juicy, greasy, flavorful, and delicious. If you can't tell, I like it. Keep in mind, making rotisserie chicken is pretty much all these people do. Their fries are average at best, their cole slaw is blah, there is no decor, and I don't really care. You shouldn't either-- you should be coming here exclusively for the chicken.I should leave you with a warning. When I was there, I noticed that a vast majority of the Latino clientele were drinking something called Inca Kola. Intrigued and wanting an authentic Peruvian experience, I decieded to try said beverege. That it looked like urine did not dissuade me. Perhaps it should have. Drinking Inca Kola was like consuming liquid cotton candy. Three days later, I came down from my sugar high.
If you are hungry (or even if you aren't) don't dare drive by this family-run restaurant when the spit is hot and the birds are on - it might cause an accident. Road, what road? All you can think is CHICKEN (Peruvian Chicken to be exact) by the quarter, half or whole. Don't wonder if it's any good. The place has been in Arlington for about 15 years!\Wash your hands well before sitting down - you can't help but lick your fingers. This is some of the juiciest and most flavorful chicken around. If plain isn't your game, they also have two sauces (but in small containers so ask for extra)-- a mayo-mustard sauce and a limey cilantro sauce that is spicier. The fries are good for dipping too - and even though it's obvious they are of the frozen variety - they are crispy. I've never tried the slaw, but it has always looked like its been swimming in mayo-water (not appealing). Inquire about the sweets. I've had the Alfajores (filled with Dulce de Leche). Oh, and the best part....it's super CHEAP.
Excellent chicken at a reasonable price.
This place no doubt has the best chicken you will ever taste. And it's so simple a child could order if only they could see over the counter to talk to the friendly staff (it's family owned I think). All you need to know if how much chicken you want, whether you want steak fries and cole slaw as sides (you do), and which kind of sauces you want (the mild is a tangy mustard-mayonnaise thing and the hot is like chopped green chiles of some kind - I recommend mixing the 2 together and make sure you get an extra - you'll want it), and what kind of drink you want I recommend trying the Inca Cola). Before they moved over to Kenmore I once ate there 6 days in a row after work because it was so close to my apartment, so freaking cheap, and so dang delicious! I can't wait to be back in Northern VA soon to make a reunion trip there.
By far the best deal in the Arlington area. Best Peruvian chicken (and there are a ton of Peruvian restaurants in the area) and best prices. Don't be fooled by the location, it may be a hole in the wall, but the food speaks for itself. Go try it, love it and become addicted
El Pollo Rico has the best Peruvian chicken around! I was a regular here when I lived in the area. Now unfortunately, I'm in the SF Bay area. That said, I can still comment on their food because I was just back there a couple of months ago. Aaron and Ryan hit most of the highlights, but don't forget to wash down your meal with Inca Kola, mmm tastes like Juicy Fruit gum.
On a meandering bike ride around Arlington back in '97, I was suddenly hit with a waft of smoke. And what smoke it was. It carried me away like Toucan Sam toward it's source, a decrepit, soon to be demolished strip mall. Plunking down a fiver or so rewarded me with the best chicken that I've ever had, before or since. Peruvian chicken a la brasa is cooked on a rotisserie, spiced with pepper and who knows what else, and served with fries and two dipping sauces: one is green, jalapeno -based and spicy, the other looks to be some kind of mustardy mayonnaise.I've been a regular over the years probably averaging once a week. I often put it to the test against other of the pollo a la brasa places around DC and have never found it wanting in comparison.I've turned on a bunch of people to EPR over the years, several of whom are equally rabid. If EPR was Amway, I'd be a millionaire by now.
Chicken, Chicken, and Chicken. Eat chicken here. People in the know call this place EPR. You can have any entree you want as long as it is roasted chicken. I believe that rotisserie chicken is their only entree. You can select quarter white, quarter dark, half, or a whole chicken. The automatic sides are a heaping pile of plain steak fries, a medium-hot green chili sauce, and a yellowish mayonnaise sauce. Everything is always freshly cooked right out of the constantly moving rotisserie spits. Every bite of chicken bursts with a tasty marinade. The best part about this place is its cheapness. A quarter white/dark + fries is less than $5. This place is always packed, but the wait is never long. The staff works like a well-oiled machine. The dining area is big and colorful, but is still a hole in the wall. Don't go on a first date here. You will eat with your hands, leave greasy, and smell like an outdoor grill.
