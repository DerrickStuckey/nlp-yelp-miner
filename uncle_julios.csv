For several years my daughter has chosen Rios for her birthday dinner with the family, we're a party of nine. The little nieces love watching the tortillas made. We start off with warm chips for the salsa and guacamole. The recipe for Rio's guacamole now includes cilantro, I like the addition, though some in our party did not. Originally ordered two small guacs, big mistake, better to get two of the large. In the past we've ordered two of the small platters and taken way too much food home. This year we ordered one of the large platters, it was just a bit shy of being enough. Next time I'll order the large platter and a rack of ribs which will be more than enough. When trying to move the platter, so that others could select their food, my hand missed the wood base and grabbed onto the HOT metal tray! As one expletive was escaping my mouth I dipped my hand into the nearest beverage glass with ice: my soda. Thankfully, the Margarita glass was too small. In a matter of seconds a manager came and gave me a package of numbing gel to apply on the burnt area. I was very impressed by the quickness of the manager and that they had this gel! So, why four stars? Our server was just not on the ball. Had to wait for water even though we'd already gotten our salsa chips and guacamole. The drink orders also took forever. My daughter, who worked at Rio for a couple of summers, said that "some people just shouldn't be servers".Again, kudos to the management for the quick response!
Today I went to uj and had the worst service! My servers name was Madison and he was horrible!!!! I was waiting at my table for almost 10 minutes before he came over not only did he take too long he got my order wrong and charged my card twice! He tried to take my plate when I was not finished and made me feel rushed because he kept asking if I was done and was quick to hand me my check. I didn't even get up before he took the book from my table! And I saw he open the book right in front of me to see the tip. I think that was beyond disrespectful! Very disappointed with my service today! I do not recommend having Madison has your server!
They are great, especially after the remodeling. They are on point with the food- quick and plenty. Great service as well. Always a solid going out option.
Frozen margs are delicious, unsure of the amount of alcohol in them but hey, they're good. A good Mexican restaurant in the area because the food isn't super greasy and it hits the spot. And it isn't fast food. And it's great for any occasion (work happy hour, friends, dates). I was a little disappointed in the hard taco shells because they were almost too brittle.
Delicious! I went today with my bae and it was better than I thought it would be. We had the calamari for an appetizer, which I thought was random choice for a Mexican restaurant, but we rolled with it. It was really good! I would get it again :) It's only offered a few days a week though. Their chips are the best chips I've had in a while. So light and crispy. Salsa is good, not spicy at all. I had the guadalajara fajita combo. It came with 3 large bacon-wrapped prawn, chicken and steak fajitas, guac, cheese, tortillas, sour cream, beans, rice, lettuce.... everything you need to be happy in life. My date had the carne asada. I had a bite and it was fantastic as well. He wanted chocolate empanadas for dessert, but apparently they discontinued them. He had a mango margarita and I had watermelon. Mine was a little stronger but both were yummy. I would go back again! It's a little pricy for some items, but it can definitely be more affordable than the feast we had. I'm trying to upload pics but it won't let me...
Consistently good!! The tableside guac is good but so is the regular guac. Fajitas are awesome - meat is tender, flavorful and verified legit by a San Diego-an. I hear they know their fajitas and tequila. Appetizer portion tamales are small meal-size and the tacos dinners are large and filling.Fast service, loud and happy customers. Great place to escape the boredom of Arlington.
Great place, great food. Service was great. Our server Matt went above and beyond for us. I loved it and I'm really picky!
Fun times! I know our server was quite entertained with my group for dinner. 5 of us came after a long #Sundayfunday. We were sat right away and the hostess said we came at the perfect time because the rush just ended. We had a great time with her and our server! She's a great server! Very attentive and engaging to the entire group. Tipped her extra for all her help!Food on the other hand was just okay. Table side guac was good, needed a little bit of salt in my opinion. I just added that myself. When she came to make the guac she didn't ask what we wanted in it. She just made it and walked off. I like mine with everything, but what if I didn't or someone was allergic to onions, which she put in without asking. Queso dip was a little watery as well. Salsa was nice and flavorful. Chip were a bit oily.We then ordered 3 carne asadas; 2 medium rare 1 medium, which both cooked properly, but the steak fajitas was supposed to be Medium rare and came out well done. It was taken back, redone and manager came and spoke with us and apologized. We ordered a round shots from the bar as well so you can't really mess that up. Again, like I said we had a great time with our server. If I come back it will be because of her!
I don't know which was better - the delicious food, or Geovanni's five star service. We had a family lunch here and he made sure everything was perfect. Thank You!!
What happened?!?!? Uncle Julios has been yuppified and bastardized. Some tight ass got ahold of this place and has turned it into a generic wasteland devoid of all the ambiance of the old place. No more stuffed animal heads, happy animal wall murals, or tomatoes in the beans. Only tacky oil paintings hung that look like 50,000 other Mexican restaurants. Boo!!! I'd love to meet the person(s) responsible to give them a piece of my mind. Also to find out if I called it right, as to what kind of person would think what they did as necessary. Not!!!
I'm giving a two star not about the food and not about the location. Food is great and the location is also great. My complaint is with the manager. Not all because I only dealt with one, so hopefully others will have better luck then me and deal with a manager that is more experienced.When you mess up on an order you don't tell the person "no that's not what you ordered". You don't then put them on hold to double check with the server , who by the way is the only person you talked to and never heard what the guest originally said; to then once again tell the guest nope your server said you said this and not that.... Don't you think maybe the server misheard them place the order? They do a great job but hey servers mess up sometimes. Sadly this manager had no motivation to make a slightly unhappy customer into a repeat customer and only made me with his actions a None repeat customer. Hopefully you have better luck and as long as you make sure your orders are right you should have a good time.
The food is just okay and very expensive. Whereas you can find similar or better fajitas in the area for $13.99-16, here they start at $18! Wait staff was good.
Good service and great margaritas, but mediocre food. That said, there's lots of it. I was particularly disappointed with the steak & chicken fajitas, which used that weird texture fake chicken that some restaurant chains pass off as the real thing. The steak was unusually fatty, even for skirt steak. Might have bumped it up to 3 stars for the overall experience if it were less expensive, but with the pricing and atmosphere it's a "2" at best.
I love this place. I am from Texas and love Mexican food. This is my favorite Mexican place in DC area. I recommend the Juanita platter. Food is authentic and tasty. Parking is available. Staff is pleasant. Place is clean and VERY importantly -- they typically seat you when they say the will or before. It can be a little loud, but it's great for kids.
I have been here twice and never left disappointed. I had the steak/chicken fajita both times and the table side guacamole. The guac was amazing, so fresh and tasty. They bring fresh chips and salsa to your table- soooo tasty! The fajita was so yummy, literally melts in your mouth when you eat it. The best part of the fajita- is the homemade tortilla. I am giving this a four stars because the side toppings that came with the fajita (cheese, sour cream, guac, tomatoes and lettuce) was meh. When I got it the first time, it looked fresh, however the second time I came, the side toppings looked like it has been sitting out for a while because the guac was already brown and the cheese had that weird oily look when it sits out for a while.
They are incapable of making vegan food.
First time visit this place, it's a very large place. As soon as we sit down, the waiter brought us a full basket of fresh chips and their smokey flavor salsa. If you like a little kick, they have Habanero salsa, which isn't too hot for me but has enough kicks to it. We had an awesome waiter because he never made us wait longer than a minute to refill our chips and drinks. I ordered the Shrimp Al Pastor fajita with vegetable & mango and Habanero sauce. It was a delicious. The diced mango and the sauce wrapped the shrimps in the fajita are the perfect combination! Very refreshing and just enough of spicy flavor to keep the appetize going. If I come back to DC next time (most likely I will), I will love to be back here and try something else :) I'll remember to take the picture then!
Went there with a party of six and each of us thoroughly enjoyed our meals. The complimentary salsa and chips are great... the chips are thin, crispy and fresh! We ordered the Queso as an appetizer...it was delicious. The Chicken Fajita Salad was fresh and plentiful, the chicken enchiladas were perfectly made. The Juanitas Platter and the Benitos Platter were delicious as well. We ended the dinner with an order of Cajeta and an order of Sopapillas for the table and we ate every bite...the Sopapillas were perfectly made, served hot, perfectly powdered and the honey was amazing. Our server, Carla, was great, she was attentive, pleasant and professional. All in all a very good experience. Definite go-to place for yummy Mexican cuisine.
Went there for a late lunch last week, and liked the experience. I ordered the carnitas fajitas and was pretty happy with the quality and the taste. Liked the salsa, although they should certainly upgrade their chips. The lunch menu is fairly priced although some of the items on the regular menu can get pretty expensive. The service was prompt, and the place wasn't too loud, say around 1-2pm on a Wednesday. Will certainly be back for more.
How I heard of this place: Haivng moved to the east coast, and finally into our first home, together, Chris and I walked by Uncle Julio's numerous times. Upon each pass, we noted that we should someday eat at the brightly colored establishment. When our friends Sam & Jenelle joined us for dinner a few months ago, they highly recommended Uncle Julio's, and asked us, again, if we had tried it when we saw them last month, and again, the other night. When our friend, Zitta was celebrating her birthday, we knew it was our time to partake of the Rio Grande Restaurant.Type of cuisine: "Uncle Julio's is committed to providing only the freshest and highest quality Border Style Mexican Food. With distinctive Hacienda decorating style, we created a unique restaurant concept around original recipes that demand only the freshest ingredients tailored after Uncle Julio's family tastes. Beyond tacos, enchiladas and tamales, Uncle Julio's specializes in marinated and mesquite grilled beef and chicken fajitas, ribs, quail, frog legs, and jumbo shrimp."Ambiance: A large space, assumed from the outside, obvious when walking around the floor-to-ceiling windowed space to find the front door, and even moreso when one steps into the dark, yet brightly-colored establishment. Chairs and tables are set apart with ample space between for people to walk to and from their tables, giving wait-staff more than enough room to carry their sizzling fajitas platters to hungry diners. The large foyer opens up onto the bar, still giving the children and young at heart something to keep themselves entertained: the flour tortilla oven. The plexi-glass case leading from the restaurant to the kitchen hosts a four-tiered rotating, glass-encased oven where the small balls of dough make their way from the top tier, down a small slide, to the next tier and so on, until they end, flattened and cooked to fluffy perfection in the white, linen-covered basket below. Matching, mini mosaic patterns surround the lights on the walls throughout the space, where parties of two, four and twenty (ours) can be easily accommodated.What I ordered: Being part of a large crowd ordering everyting from fish tacos to chicken, beef and shrimp fajitas, I opted for our server-recommended favorite: the Guadalajara ($21.95), Uncle Julio's signature grilled jumbo shrimp orochette, stuffed with Monterey Jack cheese and jalapeno, and wrapped in bacon, served with my choice of combination (chicken & beef) fajitas.Chris selected the Juarez ($19.95): pork ribs slow smoked over mesquite wood and his choice of chicken fajitas, served with a sie of chipotle barbeque sauce.Both dishes were served with a side of fresh hand-made guacamole and pico de gallo, rice, frijoles a la charra and home-made flour tortillas.What I loved: Surprisingly, I cleaned the pork ribs to the bone! The taste, the texture, the temperature. Perfect. I also loved the fresh, thick cut guacamole. The rice and frijoles, often my least favorite items on the plate, took me by surprise, and I finished every bite! The flour tortillas, cute, fluffy and filling. Of the fajitas, the chicken was my favorite! I especially loved the grilled, whole jalapeno on my personal sizzling plate.Why I loved it: The portions were reasonable; they would have been more reasonable had I not eaten the entire large bowl of oily and warm, fried, crispy, flour tortilla chips with chipotle salsa to start! The food delicious and well-prepared. The staff friendly and comfortable. The ability to accommodate a large party, amazing!Cost: Average to high ($20 average per dinner entree)
Average mexican restaurant. Prices are somewhat high for the quality of food here. They do make good Margaronas though if you're trying to drink. If you don't feel like venturing out of Ballston and want sitdown mexican, this is really your only option. But if you're willing to drive or take the metro, there are better options closer to and obviously within the city.
I have always loved going to Uncle Jullio's! Their swirls are amazing and they are very family friendly. They are one of the few "chain" restaurants that I go to again and again. The "Plato Gordo" is great and offers a platter for the whole family to share. The staff is always friendly and helpful and the food is consistently good. Definitely a good spot!
Lunch - I personally love this place - their salsa, albeit a little 'soupy' is packed with flavor! My favorite is the carnitas tacos lunch special - I could eat it everyday :) In my experience (mainly lunch) they have been quick and efficient with service. I'm giving 4 stars because a few times I've been in they've been out of the tacos and didn't tell me until after I ordered.Catering - I have UJ cater lunch in our office every so often and I must say it is quite a treat. Their staff sets up and cleans up EVERYTHING. They are always extremely kind and are on point in serving our very hungry 200+ staff. Very affordable, too!
Now, I wanted some Mexican fof lunch today, so the tacos al Carbon and Tortilla soup hit the spot. And, my server, Chase was great. So, why so few stars? It is because of something that happened to one of their servers while I was there. Poor guy. Got his foot caught while carrying a full tray of food. Yep, food went flying and he ended up flat on his back covered in food. Fortunately, they said he wasn't hurt, but he will certainly be hurting after landing on his back on the tile floors. Well, according to the reaction of some of his co-workers ,you would have thought the restaurant was a comedy show. For the rest of my lunch, all I heard was the hostess (especially!) and many others laughing hysterically about his accident. Worst example of immaturity I have seen in a long while. The manager should have put a stop to it immediately, but they were still laughing when I left. I hope the server was not seriously hurt, and I hope the rest of the laughing hyenas grow up and learn a little respect.
I've always loved Rio, but I got take out fajitas tonight (which is my go to), and the meat was barely cooked and was toughs. I don't know if the quality across the board has changed, but my meal was pathetic. Basically a waste of $25. Disappointed.
Don't ever get the grilled fish tacos. The most bland tilapia fish that was overcooked on the outside. Even their strawberry guava lemonade was pretty horrible. I think I'm pretty generous when it comes to writing reviews, but this place doesn't do the current three and a half stars justice. Not only that, but our friend made a reservation over the phone, but the tables were not ready, and they made us wait a good extra fifteen minutes. Not cool for a large crowd. What I also didn't like was the way the waitress presented the "special"- "our chef is trying out a new dish".. Yeah, no thanks. Ok, I'm done.
Delicious! This place was so good. We split the fajita platter and it was perfect for the group. I recommend this if you are looking for delicious tex-mex food.
First let's start with a tip: Park inside indoor underground parking, they will validate it for free (cause we all know how bad the parking could be in Arlington) I've been to several uncle Julio's (aka Rio Grande) in DMV area and they all seem to be on a level playing field, granted I only ever visit Rio Grande for one dish only and never had anything else and that's Steak Faijta. Now I've had many Fajitas in many places ever since I remember eating ;) but none has ever come close to Rio Grande's steak fajita, the meat is tender and flavored just right the freshly baked tortillas are on point and the grilled onions and jalapeo makes the dish complete. I basically do not waste my time with other places if I am craving fajita I'll just go straight to Uncle Julio! now for other Mexican dishes I might consider other places!
It is really hit or miss here. But when they miss.... it is by a land slide.
Used to be one of my favorite tex mex chains in the area. Started our meal last weekend with queso (delicious as always). They removed tacos al carbon from the menu but assured me after my menu was removed that the fajitas were actually cheaper. No. It was $20 for stringy steak and a side of guac with the skin mixed in. My friend ordered the daily special (chipotle quesadillas). Lucky for her she found about a 3 inch long jagged CHICKEN BONE in her meal. Unbelievable. The manager ended up comping both our meals but was less than professional in his handling of the situation. I will not be going back to this location but will stick to Chuys or the reston locaton for good tex mex from now on.
The fajitas are AMAZING!!! Definitely going back soon!! We went on a Saturday, so it was pretty busy but it didn't take too long to be seated. It was pretty loud in there but it was great because it drowned out the noise my kids were making!! ;)
My husband and I come here quite often (probably once every one or two weeks) but after our most recent experience I'm not sure if we'll be back. We met there after work, like we often do, for happy hour on the patio. We usually get some drinks and an appetizer. But today, the hostess asked us if we needed a full menu, we said no, and then we were told we had to sit at tables on the side of the building, facing the adjacent apartment buildings. The side tables are small, and literally just facing tall buildings. We explained that we wanted to sit on the front patio, and we're told we were not allowed because there was no space. I would understand if it was crowded, but it was not. And all the people on the front patio were clearly just having drinks and appetizers, but for some reason, we were not able to join them.
Best chips and salsa - hands down. They make a mean margarita, too, and don't skimp on the pour. Great cheese enchiladas. If you are vegetarian, be sure to tell the server because some of the sauces contain meat. If you are vegetarian, they can swap the sauce easily.
This place is perfect for lunch, but not for dinner.The service is incredibly rushed. My boyfriend and I were seated on the patio two Saturdays ago. It was beautiful outside. We decided on ordering guacamole as an appetizer and splitting the fajitas. Also, my boyfriend ordered a margarita. We received the guacamole and the margarita at the same time, and within less than five minutes our food was placed right in front of us. Uh okay. So we eat our fajitas and run out of tortillas (only four were given to us). I asked the waiter if we could please have more tortillas. He comes back 10 minutes later to tell me that he forgot to grab more tortillas and asked if I would like the check. Okay...So I just say sure, I would like the check. The server was impatient, rushed us, and clearly put our order in at the same time he entered the appetizer. We would've been content actually finishing our meal (or attempting to, the portions are outrageous). For a relatively expensive meal, we really got service that was less hospitable than Chipotle. I wont be returning, but if I worked in the Ballston area, I would probably stop by for lunch since they can probably have you in and out of the door in less than 30 minutes.
Calling all Texans (and part-time ones too). We will not raise the Lone Star flag over Uncle Julio's Tex-Mex! It begins with the Salsa music when you enter. They ask for your name when you enter which is weird. So I asked for their name as well. Brian was a good sport. The salsa and chips arrived promptly. It is hardly salsa. While the roasted taste presented a full body, it was soupy. The chips were light and crispy. Iced tea was fresh and flowed throughout my visit. I ordered the Jalisco Dinner which contained beef, chicken, and shrimp for fajitas. Guacamole, pica de gallo, beans, rice, and fresh flour tortillas accompanied them. The beef was slimy and chewy. The chicken was okay. The onions were under cooked. The rice was seasoned primarily with chili powder. The beans were cooked, but not quite enough. The portions were too small for the price. Overall it was just okay. Remember the Alamo, but forget Uncle Julio!
One of the benefits of living in a large metropolitan area is that you don't have to like every place you try. And thank goodness. Uncle Julio's should be the poster child for not trying all that hard. With the exception of a couple members of the wait staff, this place did not have one redeeming factor. Starting with the fact that you have virtually no choice when it comes to a cold beer. If you want a beer, just a regular beer, you're out of luck. You have to drink lite beer, or Mexican beer. That's it. No Budweiser, no Miller, nothing.... Someone's going to have to help me understand the marketing genius behind that idea. And as for the food, it was disappointing.... not awful, just blah. Even the melted cheese on my "beef" enchilada was tasteless. And I put "beef" in quotes, because it was really just crumbled up hamburger. There was no steak or anything that resembled beef in that enchilada. Oh, I did like the chips. They were light and tasty, but it didn't really matter because the soupy salsa reminded me more of ketchup than fresh salsa. In a dynamic area like Ballston/Arlington/DC, save yourself the trip. Hit El Paso Cafe at 4235 N. Pershing. That place is amazing in comparison. Good eatin' !!~Kj
Good, not great. Nice wait staff and really good and trashy frozen margaritas. (Note: think icee with tons of alcohol.)Cute neighborhood place, and we go there often because it's literally around the corner from our home. I wouldn't go out of my way, though.
This place is tex-mex heaven. Everything we have had here is fantastic, especially the lucky horseshoes. This is one of our go-to's. Understand that the environment is loud and crowded, and expect to wait unless you call ahead or go during an off-peak time. There isn't REALLY a happy hour but as long as you go in understanding these points, the food is fantastic.
This place is a carbon copy of the Pappasito's chain down in Texas, so if you love Pappasito's like I do, you will love this place. But seriously, the taste of the fajitas, the bacon wrapped shrimp, the sour cream enchilada sauce, the chips, the salsa, the music, the waiters uniforms, the prices, even the machine on display that you get to see the lady turn dough balls into tortillas... all exactly like Pappasito's Cantina.Edit, final observations: military discount only if in uniform (bad for Marines who can't wear their work uniform in town). Also the drinks are a bit pricey, the "house" Margarita is Cuervo gold, costs almost $9, and comes in a 12oz glass already filled to the brim with ice.
This is a NEVER again. The food came out wrong and cold and I was already ready to end our relationship with this spot until the manager came over- he was sincerely apologetic, friendly and turned the bad food experience around and we even said "okay, we'll give it another shot"...... All's well that ALMOST ends well. On the way to our car we find a server taking pictures and on the phone with the police claiming we "damaged his car" two black cars and white paint on his bumper and he's berating us about his car yelling that he has our license plate and carrying on. We couldn't even believe the absurdity and audacity of this guy who's creating this ridiculous scene RIGHT OUTSUDE THE RESTAURANT in his uniform and in front of the entire patio and restaurant windows! What an incredible unprofessional shitshow that we will ABSOLUTELY tell everyone about, including the cops who laughed harder than we did and speculated insurance fraud. Wow. I want my Sunday back.
Service takes FOREVER- but if you are willing to wait they have delicious margaritas, fajitas and guacamole. I would recommend splitting once order of fajitas between two people because it is way more than enough for one.
Best Mexican / Texan restaurant In northern VA area, best fajitas and if you like shrimp and bacon get the Guadalajara platter it's bomb!
We've been here several times over the past several years, and I think it's actually improving. First, we love the new table-side guacamole service. They make it for you from fresh ingredients as you watch, and it's great too. I just wish the chips weren't so thin. They don't hold up to the guacamole. And their grilled chicken, both as a platter and in fajitas is delicious. Tender and juicy, not overcooked. Lots of options for kids. Unfortunately, they have an extremely limited beer and wine selection. It's in Ballston, so of course, parking is a challenge. But the thing that drives me the most nuts is the volume. Even when only partially full, the place is unusually LOUD. I can rarely hear the people at my table speaking unless they're yelling. But the food is pretty darn good. Not a lot of good Mexican in the area, so this one stands out for its food.
We love this place. Food is delicious so are drinks. Best Mexican food in the area . And service is great!
Delicious, fast and lively atmosphere. My friends and I go here a lot and my parents too. The place is so huge you never have to wait and the outdoor seating is great, too. The free chips are delish but a little thin so be careful when dipping in the salsa. Fajitas are tasty and I love the black beans and rice. Guac is creamy and chunky at the same time. They make the tortillas in the front so they are always warm. Portions are big too so you can score some leftovers.
I had dinner here last night and the food was pretty tasty. We also ordered the table side guacamole and it was really good. I have to say that this was the best Tex-Mex that I've had in this area.
I am not a fan of Mexican food and yet, Uncle Julio's won me over! The food is very fresh, in fact, the tortillas are made right in front of the customers! The amount of cheese is controlled which is something I really appreciate as a lot of restaurants make up in the humongous amount of cheese and cream what they cannot create in original spices.I had the shrimp quesedillas and loved it thoroughly. The quantity was so big that I had to box a big portion of my meal up and carry it home with me. I heated and enjoyed the delicious meal the net day once again! One of the best features is the table side, freshly made, authentic guacamole. The taste and the creamy texture were on a totally different level! Love it!The only two bummers are: it is a tad bit on the more expensive side for a Mexican restaurant and secondly, the place is damn noisy! I understand it is a family place and children love to eat here too....but it is so noisy that at times I couldn't hear what my own table-mates were saying or what our server was saying. Those two are the only drawbacks. All in all....good, wholesome, fresh, delicious food in generous amounts and good service!
For some reasons this restaurant does not pay attention to anything I say.1- I called ahead to add our names to the list knowing the line would be long. The wait would be as long as an hour and half. When I called for "call ahead". They told me, "We do not take reservations." I explained I am not asking for a reservation, but a call ahead which they do accept. "We do not take reservations", they said again. I became frustrated and asked if our names could be added to the list and we'll be there in 15 minutes. The lady said they do not take a reservation. Ugh. When we arrived, we saw the person taking call aheads. Infuriated, I asked for a manager. When he came, I explained my situation and he went, "the caller did not understand you." What?! I was clear when I asked "call ahead". What part of it didn't they understand?  The manager told me to be fair for others, we need to wait. I told him how is that fair that others could call ahead, but not us? He said good point and allowed us to be seated. That was what I was appreciative of. We ordered our usual: chicken fajitas. They are really good. Everything from chips and salsa to A to Z of our fajitas. 2- We came to the same restaurant moving on with what happened past few weeks ago. When the server asked us where we would like to be seated: inside or outside? We both said outside. She lead us to... a table inside! I told her I specifically asked for outside and she went, oh? You did?  Yes, I did. We were able to sit outside. Again, the fajitas were really good!! The food is worth for your money, however, I'll be prepared to come to the restaurant having the worker there not to pay attention to anything I say.
I have always enjoyed every visit I've had at Uncle Julios. Yes, its pretty expensive for mexican - but the food has always been great.First - the chips are wonderful in my opinion. Very thin and almost melt in your mouth feel. For the main meal I 90\% of the time go with the chicken and steak fajitas - which is more than enough food. The plate always comes out sizzling (like it should be), and the homemade tortillas are soft, warm and delicious. I've also had their tacos, and enchiladas and they're good as well. If I were looking for just a cheap and fast combo tex-mex meal, this isn't the place to get it. That's why I always go with fajitas here. They're spot on even though its a $20 meal. Outdoor seating in nice weather is a plus also. The only reason its not a 5 star is due to the prices.
Food is 4 stars. Minus a star for value - you pay $3 extra (for the 2-person plate) for sour cream/cheese/veggies for fajitas, which should be standard. And it's kind of pricey for the portion size. Still, the fajitas were great. I'd definitely come back, even though they don't serve burritos. Service was great, and I appreciate the free chips and salsa.
I discovered UJ about 3-4 years ago at Fairfax Corner. Smitten with their food and drinks!How long do you want me to make this review? Okay, ok, okey--I'll make it sweet!Classic Tacos soft or shell are GREAT! Ground beef, pork, chicken, steak all are seasoned the Uncle Julio's way!Drinks are always great! Sip one and try to get up and walk afterwards. (LOL--maybe I'm just a light weight)My love always orders the Diablo (6 mesq. grilled shrimp)--he swears they're the best.I can't forget the QUESO. Smooth, creamy, and just enough spice. Order the bowl (large).This is the first place I tried guac--they have table side prep for guac. Good.They give you a lot of food--you won't leave hungry.Good for groups and children.Very loud.The staff are always pleasant. (We go enough--we're on first name basis with several of them.)Go on an empty stomach.Enjoy!!!!!
Sides have gotten smaller. Still good but service can be variable.
Tex-Mex way over priced. The food and drinks are ok but way overpriced, especially the drinks. There are other local Mexican places close that serve more authentic mexican food.
Went in on a Monday around noon; not very busy.I ordered a staple; shredded chicken tacos. Food came quick. When I went to put some salsa on taco # 1 I noted a white-ish golf ball sized blob of something inside...turned out to be cheese in the worst possible presentation...no thanks. When pointed out to the server he reacted as if that was normal. Only thing that save this place is the chips and salsa...they are mostly concerned with getting you in and getting you out.
I thought this place was pretty good, for a chain. I got some sort of platter that had fajitas and a rack of ribs. My date got a platter with tamales and tacos, and I can say that my plate was far superior to his. I guess the best part about my dining experience were the margaritas. Very good. The waitress was nice and the ambiance was ok. I would have preferred to sit outside but there was a wait. The chips are the thin kind and the salsa is good too. I'd recommend getting some sort of fajita dish or something from the grill here.
The Skinny: Way overpriced (they charge for sour cream) and loud for subpar Tex-Mex.Upsides: 1. Location right off Ballston metro 2. Free chips and salsa are pretty good3. Chicken fajita cobb is good, but for $13.99 priceyDownsides:1. Overpriced 2. Very noisy 3. Food is subpar - enchiladas and fajitas don't do much Overall, food is subpar and overpriced. Loud.
A little too expensive, and not too tasty. I just wanted a little more.
I grew up in Texas, so I have a pretty high standard for Tex-Mex cuisine. Uncle Julio's was right on par with what I consider "good" Tex-Mex.While the wait times can be absurd on weekends, as long as you plan ahead somewhat, you can get a table pretty fast. The environment is the typical Tex-Mex decor - don't expect anything special.For my drink, I tried the Swirl that they are famous for, and I have to admit, it was pretty good. The blend of frozen sangria and frozen margarita goes together really well. Their standard salsa for the tortilla chips is actually pretty spicy, which was a pleasant surprise. For my main course, I ordered the chicken enchiladas verdes, and they were comparable to some of the better places down in Texas (though certainly not the best).Overall, a nice spot to hang out, get margaritas, and get some nice Tex-Mex - don't expect anything super special.
Circa 1992, I was a hostess during high school at the Uncle Julio's Bethesda branch along with my best friend. We met the coolest fellow co-workers who were mostly in college and we had our share of partying after work. And took advantage of the employee discount to eat there so hence I'm biased. I love Rio Grande Cafe!! Their swirls are amazingly smooth and strong. Don't drink too fast because you will get brain freeze! Every time in my case! Can't help myself. Fresh hot chips are just the right light crisp and salsa adds lots of cilantro oniony tomatoey goodness for scooping. This was my first time to Ballston location (Reston is my most frequented). First the hostess sat us in the middle of the dining room where there were plenty of seats with a little bit more privacy. We asked to be moved a little more to the side and the she stuck us to a table wedged close between two four tops. Not really nice and quiet for us so BF and I sat at the bar to watch the World Cup. Tortilla soup was piping hot with lots of avocados. My grilled fish tacos with the avocado cream on the side was soooooo gooood. My BF was very happy with his grilled salmon atop fresh sauted vegetables. He ate the entire plate and he's not a fan of zucchini (well until now!!!). The only thing we agreed that was bad was the crunchy undercooked rice. Flavor was good but way undercooked. I love this place but parking garage for the building is a little pricy. $5 for the first hour, $10 after the first hour.
We were trying to find a replacement for our favorite Tex Mex in Boston, and we've finally found it. The chicken quesadillas are excellent but should be split by two people, and you can even see someone making the tortillas when you walk in. The margaritas are pretty fabulous, too. Prices are very reasonable. Chips and salsa are given as an appetizer. This is our new go-to for Mexican!
If you wanna get your fajitas on, this is a good place to be. My favorite dish is the steak fajitas. I'm never disappointed and have leftovers if I don't share. Makes a great brunch the next day if you add some scrambled eggs. Love the chips and salsa and if I'm feeling decadent I love to get the combo gauc and chilli con queso. Margaritas are good. If I'm trying to eat heathy I get the salads. Wish the salads were on the lunch menu with a discounted price. There is parking underneath the building and be sure to bring the card to get it validated. Can bask in the fresh air with the outdoor patio in the nice weather.
You got to try the carnitas tacos. It's had such good meat, taco shells and cheese. The salsa is really good too. They make tortillas by hand too which is so good!
I went here with my family for an early dinner. The restaurant is gigantic, so I doubt that wait times are ever particularly long. We got vegetable fajitas, which comes with guacamole, homemade tortillas, spicy beans, etc. Everything was pretty good, but the homemade tortillas stole the show. So good!! The service was also excellent; our glasses were never empty, and they constantly refilled our chips at the beginning of the meal. The sides of beans were "meh", but mainly we were just disappointed that we didn't get those delicious puddles of refried beans that other mexican places dole out. My only real qualm: the price. I feel like tex-mex shouldn't be so expensive. Almost $15.29 for a veggie fajita? Yikes.
In a nutshell: Parking was easy. The restaurant has a good vibe, friendly staff, tasty food, but is somewhat overpriced.Tip: If you park your car in the underground garage behind the restaurant, UJ's will validate your parking for you.The ambiance inside the restaurant is relaxed and fun, and all of the staff that my GF and I encountered were very friendly and efficient -- we were barely seated when we were served fresh chips and salsa. The salsa was quite mild, but our waitress brought us a second dish of their hot version -- which wasn't crazy hot, but had a nice little kick.We ordered from the lunch menu -- a frozen swirl margarita to share, and beef and chicken fajita's for two. We also got both corn and flour tortillas to go with the fajita's -- no problem there; the waitress was cheerful and happy to oblige.The service was very fast -- the margarita arrived within 2 or 3 minutes, and the fajitas followed maybe 5-7 minutes later. The margarita was tasty, and the food was delicious and plentiful -- the best beef I've ever had in a fajita, cooked about medium, and very flavorful; the chicken was also very good. We were served individual portions of rice and beans, and the fajita's came with the usual array of sides. One thing I would have liked quite a bit more of was onions and peppers to go with the fajita's -- there weren't a ton of those.We got a bit of a shock when the bill arrived, as the lunch menu had shown fajitas for one to be around $15. At an old favorite restaurant of mine, they had fajitas for one at around $14, and it went up to about $18 for two. Our fajitas were $34.99 -- I think that's too high. I asked the manager if there had maybe been a mistake -- he was very friendly and took the bill away to "see what he could do." It turns out that we had been charged for the dinner fajitas and he reduced our bill by about $5 -- that helped.All in all, we'll go back again -- I might have given 5 stars if the prices weren't quite so high.
I've done more drinking and hanging out than eating here. Their chips and salsa are money and I've always loved their signature swirls (combo sangria and margarita). The service has always been sub-par and food is a bit overpriced, but it's fun place to come for after work drinks. It's nice that they have outdoor seating for beautiful weather too.
Not good. Drinks are overpriced and subpar. There was no clear definition to the place ... with 5-year olds running around, 10-year olds screaming, 18-year old trying to sneak drinks in, and 45 year olds acting like they are 30. It was just a melting pot mixture with subpar atmosphere.
My boyfriend and I came here for dinner on a Saturday night. The place was packed, but we did not have to wait too long to be seated. The noise level throughout the restaurant was very, very loud.I ordered a margarita and it was sickeningly sweet. My boyfriend enjoyed his fajitas but my grilled fish tacos were a bit bland. Thankfully, there are a few vegetarian/pescatarian items on the menu. The salsa that they had on the table was very watery but I liked the smoky, spicy kick and I did appreciate that they make the tortilla chips in house. They were warm and delicious. Both my boyfriend and I enjoyed the queso as well.I don't want to come back here, but I probably will because the boy loves this place. The things we do for love.
I dunno. The food was great, Fajita steak cooked just how I like it, but the prices/menu add-ons were noticeably higher in price than other local tex-mex restaurants of the same caliber (Fuego, Guapos). Our server was nice enough, but his knowledge of the menu was hit and miss for most items we ordered. Overall, I'd say there are better Mexican dinner restaurants close by with prices that don't shock the wallet as much.
Food was not hot. They forgot the sauce that goes with my order and the utensils to eat with. Do not go when they're busy. The front desk is rude and they'll mess up your order. Disappointing.
Delicious food! I'm not a huge fan of Mexican food but my husband is so we went and I was pleasantly surprised. If I went back I would literally order the steak alone, it was so full of flavor! It was really noisy, but the food made up for it.
The service is excellent. Today we were celebrating a going away party for our friend and Jake Gyllenhaal himself served our table. What a treat. He was on point, very attentive and communicative, and just overall fantastic. Apparently he has finally been able to "quit" Heath Ledger. The rest of the peasant service staff were good as well, but my buddy Jake took the cake. I mean have you seen Source Code. We had the Prince of Persia himself waiting on our table. Just awesome. As a restaurant goes we were very satisfied. I hope to return for a sequel appearance of Mr. Gyllenhaal soon. Well done good sir.
I have been coming here for years. Lately, since they added the table side guacamole the service has been bad. The first time we ordered the guacamole it came after the food had arrived. So we canceled it. The second tie it came quickly but then we waited forever to get chips and order food. We didn't have silverware or napkins while having the guacamole either. It's too bad because the food is good. The price is kind of high, so I expect better service.
The food was fantastic, I'd definitely recommend their carnitas or skirt steak. Food was excellent for the price.The place is loud, crowded, and very loud, but what restaurant isn't in Ballston when it's 75 degrees on a Saturday evening.Best value joint in the area for a sit down, and the service for being as busy as it was is attentive and great.
Fine place, good bar area and good ( while generic) tex mex offerings. I will say that the flour tortillas taste great but otherwise HH is the best option here.
The service at this location is too bad to deal with. Great food but never going back to this location.
My bf and I visited Uncle Julio's on a lazy Saturday afternoon last week. It wasn't quite warm enough outside to sit on the patio, but we were craving margaritas and mojitos so we lounged around inside and grabbed some delicious cocktails. We order the mojito and the frozen strawberry margarita and they were delicious! We also enjoyed the chips and salsa and decided to order a guacamole dish. We went with the very creative Pineapple Bacon guacamole (Pineapple, hickory smoked bacon, and crumbled Queso fresco) and really enjoyed it! Maybe not the pineapple part so much, but bacon is always amazing with guac! We didn't order any entrees, since it was 4pm and we weren't quite ready for dinner yet, but I'm sure the food is great, if the guacamole is any indication. And I've visited the Uncle Julio's in Gaithersburg and really loved the food there. Overall, it's a really nice experience and I would love to visit again and lounge about on the patio.
The fajitas here are amazing. I used to just get the steak, which are sliced pieces of flank steak, well marinated and cooked medium, unless otherwise specified. Now, I get a combination of chicken and steak, since my friend always got the chicken and the taste was also amazing, I couldn't make up my mind. Flour tortillas are cooked fresh by the front door, and are always nice and warm. They charge extra for sour cream and cheese, which I think is pretty lame, but I need it so I get it.The salsa is so good that I crush chips up in it and eat it like a tortilla soup. The salsa is made fresh, which can be a problem when the peppers they use are too hot. There is no consistency in the spiciness of their salsa, which can get annoying at times.  Service is always excellent and fast. I have never had to wait, as a matter a fact, sometimes the food comes out so fast that I wait to order so I can enjoy a few margaritas and some chips. I get the frozen margarita with a grand marnier melt down, where they pour some on top. Two of those and you will be feeling right!There is parking in the garage, which they will validate, so it will only cost $2.50. This is a lot better than hunting for parking on the street, b/c it is pretty scarce. All in all, these are the best fajitas I have had in DC. Do yourself and favor and go!
The margaritas were sickly sweet, the tortilla soup was tasteless, and everything else was too salty. Also, it was a bit pricy and the service a tad slow. All in all, a well rounded dining experience. (With validated parking!)
I'm from the Southwest, so it's really great to find authentic flavors and great Mexican food so close to home here in Arlington! Love the salsa and tamales! The guacamole is magical. This is my favorite restaurant in the neighborhood.
Been here twice, and I think if you keep in mind what this place is (Americanized mexican, and family friendly), you'll like what you get. The outdoor patio is lovely in the summer, and both times I've been here, the service has been attentive. Never a moment where I wasn't sitting next to a nearly full basket of chips. I've also always really liked the food. I think the first time I got shrimp, and the second time carne asada. Both times it was super flavorful. It's a tad on the pricey side, but you do get a lot of food for the money. It can also get loud with so many families. But, I can't take it out on Uncle Julio for being a type of food that kids like.
Literally the most HORRIBLE place I've ever been to, and the WORST experience I have every had at a restaurant in Arlington or DC for that matter. I was with a group of15 people. We knew we were a large group so we called ahead they told us to come in at 8:15 PM. We were all there right on the dot. The made us wait 2 HOURS!!! Literally 2 HOURS and they never even seated us or offered us anything while we waited. Me and a friend had to go to the back ourselves to get chips. Finally we were all starving and decided to scatter around the bar to try and eat many of us standing. I was a a very small table by the bar when we finally had to grab someone and they only gave us the gluten free menu. It was bizarre. This place was so awful I felt like I was on a TV pranking show. The food finally care I ordered the vegetarian fajitas. They they came over and told me they were out of every vegetable except zucchini, but they could give me extra zucchini. Beyond ridiculous. I was starving at this point and ate my disgusting fajitas. Also my friend go chicken and said it was definitely just microwaved. I would go anywhere over this place and I will never ever forget the horrendous time I had there. If you like the taste of food or moderately good service STAY AWAY!!!!
not bad but nothing terribly special.
About a 2-2:5: The place was packed with families and groups alike, so I was definitely excited. Our waiter was nice and fast, but he did forget to include certain items as part of our order. The salsa that came with the complimentary tortilla chips, I was not a fan - it had a chipotle flavoring to it and was very watered down. The chips were thin and quite crispy, and even better being right out of the fryer! We ordered a cup of the queso dip with chorizo, and although there were some chunks of the meat throughout, most of them were very fatty; the cheese had a plastic-like texture to it, and the taste was just okay. My husband had the Fajitas al Carbon, with the steak option, done medium, and I wasn't a fan of the spices they used. The tortillas were nice and fresh, since they were made on the premise (the tortilla maker/contraption is at the front by the entrance). I had the Camarones Brochette, under 'Uncle Julio's Favorites,' it seemed as if the shrimp and the bacon were undercooked; they each had a pepper jack cheese cube inside the shrimp, but these weren't melted. I think I only enjoyed the guacamole as that was fresh, creamy, and tasty! I did like their chips and guac, but their entrees were not what I expected.+fresh tortilla chips+undercooked seafood (!!!)+good guacamole!
Delicious margaritas, great food! A little expensive, but you get a lot of food for your money. On a Saturday night it was packed and we waiting about 45 minutes for a table for 2, but the bartenders were great and made the wait very easy! I will definietly be back again!
Rio Grande holds a special place in my heart... I just love their swirls and I've had such good times with friends at this place. Their fajitas are excellent and the hand shredded cheese and soft tortillas are just delightful. My only complaint is that the food is brought out a little too quickly - I wish I had more time to enjoy the chips and salsa and my swirl!
I've been going to the Bethesda one for years, and am thrilled to finally be within walking distance from an Uncle Julio's after moving to Ballston recently. While it's not the fanciest place and can be crowded and loud, but the food itself is far and away the best Mexican in the area. While the standard Mexican fare is all there, some of their basic stuff really stands out (best restaurant salsa around by miles, and the guac is legit too) and my particular favorites include the Chicken Tamales appetizers and the Carne Asada (which is massive, but always delicious and worth it's weight). The frozen drinks (sangrias especially) are pretty awesome too.
Not Tex-Mex. Trust me, I'm Texan.If you want cheap food that's a little overpriced but reminds you of the cheapo restaurants reminding you of Tex-Mex, this is your spot. It's like a step above Taco Bell, but the prices are a bit high. Obviously that means the queso is gonna be pretty good tho. I thought the fajitas were ok and was impressed they gave substituted corn tortillas for the flour ones with no extra charge.Here's the thing, maybe I'm being too tough because there really aren't any good tex-mex restaurants around and I'm a little bitter about it. But when I look at the "Meh. I've experienced better." description for 2 stars, that's exactly how I feel.
Love it
Consistently good quality Tex-Mex. Nothing that'll blow you away, but you can count on it to hit the spot when you're in the mood. Fresh chips and salsa are fantastic. Guac is house-made and always fresh. Plenty of tables but can get busy, requiring a wait, on weekend nights. We've gone back on a regular basis, and that says a lot about a restaurant, especially when there's so many choices around here.
Guapos is way better if you are looking for good margaritas and traditional mexican food. The margaritas at uncle julios have less liquor. The food is sloppier and not as fresh tasting as guapos.
Their food is heaven! This is the most delicious mexican food ever. I have been here at least 15 times now. The interiors are very different and look quite ethnic. I love the raspberry tea and mango lemonade. I love their side dishes, especially the fruit salad with cream. They have a wide range of Mexican food and everyone can find something to their liking here. The waiters sometimes do a lousy job and may not deliver order properly at first but overall, my experiences have been great here!
3 wordsChile con quesoChips and salsaMargarita rocks salt
I consider myself a foodie, so I'm a little embarrassed to rank a chain so highly, but I absolutely love their steak fajitas. The marinade is really lovely, and the entree portion for one is more than enough for two to share. The free charred salsa they bring with warm, thin, salty tortilla chips is addictive. Between the two it's a great, filling, inexpensive meal that I do keep coming back for.
Delicious,try their special beef stake,very yummy.And also ask for their in house made pita bread.Thank you .
This place didn't do it for me. My fish tacos didn't have the same panache as the one in Potomac Town Center in Woodbridge. My husband liked his ribs and steak combo or whatever it was. Meat was seasoned well and tender. Kid's quesadilla tasted like a grilled cheese sandwich; it had too much cheese. Service was extremely fast. Most people's food was out in 10 minutes or less it seemed, but the restaurant is not as pretty inside as it is in Woodbridge.
I used to really like this place. But then ( to my and the server's surprise ) the manager acted like making a quesadilla with ground beef required an act of congress. Such a shame!
My review is mostly about the service, but a quick note about the food:The salsa is delicious, with a smoky spicy flavor and chunks of tomato, onion, and pepper. Much better than your run-of-the-mill pasta sauce-like salsa you get at many chain Mex restaurants.The drinks were great, the flour tortillas are amazing and freshly cooked right before they're served to you--come to the table warm and fluffy. We ordered the queso dip and our server, because he was so wonderful, gave us tortillas to try with it. Great suggestion, because it was delicious. I probably could have filled up on tortillas and queso alone.I had the fish tacos, my mother had the enchiladas. Both dishes were amazing and flavorful, came with delicious cilantro rice and two different kinds of beans ( I had spicy black beans, and she was served pinto beans in a yummy looking sauce). The dishes also came with a sour cream/avocado sauce and lettuce,tomato, and onion (pico de gallo). Now for the service. We had the fortune of being served by Jeffrey ( not sure if this is how he spells his name). He was wonderful: not only was he kind, friendly, and attentive, but he was a great conversationalist and kept us laughing the entire meal. Living in DC, I feel like its rare you get a truly pleasant server who really goes out of his/her way to be not only accommodating but personable. Jeffrey is that guy. He was a pleasure to meet and went out of his way to make us have the best experience. So glad we stopped in here; I will definitely be going back and requesting his section. Uncle Julio's, he's a great employee!
The food is delicious! The carnitas tacos are my favorite over any other mex or mex/mix restaurant in the area. The frozen margaritas are delicious (try the swirl - frozen sangria and margarita mixed). The variety of guacamole dips are the true crowd pleaser, I love the pineapple bacon! The only drawback is the dining room is one big open area and it can get pretty noisy. I still highly recommend this restaurant.
The steak in my fajita was SO unpleasant. I felt like I was chewing on rubber! No matter how many times I gnawed at it, it would not break apart. What a horrible experience!
This is a pretty standard Uncle Julio's. The food was good, but the chips and salsa were definitely my favorite! Their mojito was tasty, but their frozen sangria was a bit odd. The outdoor seating was definitely a plus though!
Standard Tex Mex with a "get 'em in, turn 'em fast" attitude. The outside seating was the draw on a nice summer night, but it will be the only reason to return.Salsa- fine. Nice crispy chips.Guacamole - hastily prepared with little seasoning. Huge chunks of avocado. Kudos for using lots of avocado, but need to mix it a little more.Ribs - great smoke flavor but waaaaaay too dry.Beef fajitas - tasted like they were seasoned with canned beef broth. Plentiful, though.Shrimp diablo -good. Best dish of the night.Margaritas - watery. Overall, service was quick but distracted.
I love this place! We are from AZ and have nothing near as good as this food. Margs are awesome.  Please partake of this place. It is in word...money! We ate hear twice is a 4 day span just o get our fill. Highly recommend!
We frequent Uncle Julio's often and have always been pleased with the experience, until today. I ordered chicken fajitas and the chicken was very fatty and had the skin on it still. Definitely a disappointment....the waiter didnt seem to really care about my dissatisfaction. The chips were good and the queso was great- the chicken fajitas were definitely not worth my $18. Boo for Uncle Julio!!! Fail.
Our favorite stop on our annual DC Trips! Great Sangria and Margaritas... amazing fajitas and burritos... the kids are happy... the parents are happy... and we all get to sit on the patio with big smiles! Makes for a successful vacation each trip for sure
My fav Mexican place in the whole area, and I was born in TX. Guacamole is AMAZING. Love the fajitas. Tortillas are yummy.
The service was poor and the food was very disappointing. Waiter initially seemed friendly enough, but never once came by to check on us for water refills, the requested straws for our water never came, and we waited 30 mins. for our food. Food itself was flavorless. My daughter's grilled vegs. - the thick slice of onion was just plain raw. My husband's salmon had no taste and my fish tacos were okay, nothing to write home about! Save your money, go somewhere else. Maybe it was just bad luck.....the place always was packed with people, but at those prices, will not bother to go back to find out.
The service was bad. The waiter hardly ever came to the table.The amount of cheese given for two people for a shared meal was small and when we asked for more cheese we were charged.The prices were high for the food we were given. I did like meat, and there were hardly any veggies served. Maybe if we were lucky one whole slice of onion and 8 pieces of pepper a few red and a few green.They need wait staff to hover around the people more, and take advantage of saying hi after serving food to a near by table.Maybe if they want a dish for 2 or 3 give them enough food so they do not have to ask for more cheese.
I haven't been here since I visited my cousin who was an undergrad at Howard in early 2000s. It was just called Rio Grande then. As someone who lived in California and New Mexico; and grew up in Texas, I'm very particular about my Mexican food. The DMV offer very little authentic Mexican food that tasted good. Rio Grande was my escape. The continue to offer high quality food at an affordable price. Nothing has changed, and I will be back.
This place is really not that good. A friend and I went a few nights ago and I was excited to try some decent Tex-Mex food. Boy, was I disappointed. My friend and I ordered the guacamole which was laughably bad (the guacamole at Trader Joe's is better and is way more inexpensive) and the combination plate that I tried was just very bland. Food is extremely overpriced and not worth it. There are better restaurants in the area; save your money and go elsewhere.
Best salsa and chips I've ever had no lie. Fajitas were amazing as well some of the best I've had. But for real get the chips and salsa it's bottomless and amazing
Great happy hour specials, half off all drinks. Food is also really good.
This place was awful. The margarita tasted like saltwater and when I asked for a drink recommendation the waiter automatically recommended the most expensive one. A LARGE guacamole looks like a side serving and it was not good. This place is so close to me and I love Mexican . Such a shame but I will never be back.
Consistently good quality food. I don't think I've ever had anything bad here. The menu hasn't changed all that much over my lifetime--it has been open that long! Try the swirly margarita, the steak fajitas, the flan, and you must have the Bacon Wrapped Shrimp--omg. The ceviche is different--not bad--just different. Not for: Vegetarians or online orders or calorie oounters--have fun people! :)
Had a pretty decent meal here. Service wasn't the best, but overall it was a good dinner! (Not a fan of their sangria, it was too sweet)
Get the carne asada, medium rare. So tender and delicious! Raspberry palmer is a fun, refreshing drink. The large guacamole is underwhelmingly small and a bit too salty.
Would have gave 5 stars if it wasn't for the hard undercooked rice and the fajita steak being somewhat chewy, but otherwise it was Great! The Swirl drink had me feeling tipsy so the food tasted extra good lol. I'm not an avid guacamole eater, but theirs was so delish!
Yum!!
I don't drink frozen margaritas often, but these are worth every single calorie. They taste fresh and not like they're coming from a mix. They're also not overly sweet. The fresh tortilla chips are warm and amazing.I showed up with one friend around 6pm on a Friday night and we were told there'd be a 45-minute wait. We hovered for bar tables, and were seated within 10 minutes. They have happy hour, which goes until 6pm.
If I could give it no stars I would. Ordered food for delivery around 8:46 pm with an estimated delivery time of 9:45 to 9:55. I had to cal near 10:50 pm to ask what was going on with the food. I was told it would be 15 min...it was delivered about 11:30pm. Now to be fair I was given a half off discount, that if I had known for sure the food would have been as cold an inedible as what my wife ate, I would have asked to cancel the order. Maybe its better in the physical place but do not order food from them online AT ALL. Even cold its not he WORST Mexican ever, just the slowest delivered. I should have ordered from chevys fresh mex.
I cannot get enough of this place. I go here guilt free whenever I am hungover and stuff myself with chicken fajitas or occasionally the huevos rancheros if I am there for brunch. Chicken fajitas for 1 is usually enough for 2 people (2 women). Great patio also!
Good Mexico food, but grossly overpriced. Fajitas for two are 32 dollars and they charge you extra for cheese and sour cream, which is ridiculous because those items usually come complimentary with Mexican food. Everything at this place is just very pricey
Delicious and amazing food, but if you want to be full be prepared to pay the price. Other then the price the food is good.
I'm no fan of Mexican food and the drinks were over-priced but the service was GREAT!!!!
Leaving the rating the same - I went to Uncle Julios again last night, and just wanted to update with a couple of notes:1 - if trying to be vegetarian (which I sometimes do), opt for the black beans. I'm told the refried beans have pork in them2 - a bean burrito is not on their menuI ordered the cheese enchilada and was pleased with my order - especially with that great salsa.
Uncle Julio's is awesome. Their food is consistently fresh, hot, and delicious! I love their chips, salsa, and guacamole. Their ceviche appetizer is not the best I've had but it's always at least adequate, usually pretty tasty. Their entrees and drinks are what set Uncle Julio's apart from other mexican restaurants in my opinion. Their swirl with the extra tequila shot on top is amazing, have a couple of those and you will be well on your way to having a solid buzz. This place is moderately pricey but you definitely get your money's worth from Uncle Julio's. I've dined at both the Fairfax Corner location and the Arlington location and both are comprable as far as service and food go. The Arlington location is a little more conducive to outdoor drinking on the patio and people watching. I have had the fajitas, tacos, enchiladas, and burritos here and everything is always SO GOOD! Outside of authentic mexican food in Mexico, I think this is definitely the best place this side of the border. Love this place!
A solid 2.5 that really hit the spot for me today. After a fairly crummy day at work, I was looking to stuff myself with meat, carbs, fat, and cheese. I also wasn't in the mood to go very far, so today seemed to be the perfect day to try out Uncle Julio's a block away from home. Now, when we go out to eat, we typically try to find somewhere that will give us at least an above-average dining experience--today was not one of those days. I just wanted something gorge-worthy. We'd only been to Guapos, and this place seemed to be pretty much the same thing. The interior looked about the same, the menu had essentially the same items; in fact, my husband keeps inadvertently referring to this place as "the Guapos just down the street." When our waiter asked if we'd ever been here before, we answered "no...but we've been to Guapos." He answered, "we're much better." The house-made tortillas were slightly better than Guapos. And the smoky salsa was better and had a more intricate taste than the regular salsa you get at Guapos. We ordered the pulled chicken quesadilla and the Juanita platter, with one beef taco, one beef and one chicken enchilada, and one pork tamale. In stark contrast to the light crispy tortilla, all of the wrappers on our food was dry with a stale texture. The beef was regular ground beef that you could get at any supermarket. The pulled chicken was pretty good, and the cheese was thick and a bit dry. Overall, it was the kind of food that you could just gorge on without much thought or particular appreciation. I'd have to agree with our waiter, that Uncle Julios is at least slightly better than Guapos. But essentially, it's the same thing. If you like this kind of food, I can't imagine there are significantly better options elsewhere. A-OK in my book.
I went there with a group of friends, there was five of us total. The night we went was a slow one, there were not that many people in the restaurant. We got seated right in front of the entrance to the kitchen, which is where everyone wants to sit! Our waiter must have been pretty new, he was nervous and stumbled over his words constantly. The food was decent, average Mexican food. Our waiter was not very attentive and we had to flag him down every time we wanted something, not once did he stop and ask if we needed anything. When we were done eating it took us almost 20 minutes to get his attention to bring the check. Then he never came back for it. Another waiter took it. All the while no one cleared our table. This is THE worst thing you can do as a restaurant. When I'm done with my food, please take the plates away. No one wants to sit and stare at the plates for 40 minutes. It will be a while before I go back here. There are plenty of other great Mexican places around.
I probably come to this place much too often and it's probably most of the reason why I have to run. They have the most amazing chips, salsa and queso around and I usually eat at least a full bowl of chips each time I go and just skip dinner. The dinner menu is also pretty good, though and I recommend the chicken enchiladas with sour cream sauce. I'm used to most places offering red or green sauce so this is just different and very good. They also have a patio out front that is really good for the warm summer months.
When the better half went to the location in Reston he thought I would enjoy this spot since we're in the area. Yes, please. Great timing since it was packing up quite quickly. A fusion of young adults and young families were steadily making their entrances. Friendly gentleman host/manager (?) and an aesthetic enthusiastic server.Also lucked out on great street parking since today was uber windy frigid outside....I was shivering like an italian greyhound without a cozy dog sweater - yeah, the wind was mighty raw, my friends. BTW, the side building with the chimes - how do your residential neighbors not complain? Hauntingly annoying~ Or are other buildings business locations? Just typing/thinking...Once I stopped quivering from the cold I'm soooo happy that our lovely server suggested the mango passion lemonade - I heart passion fruit and mango. Glad she asked if this was my first time here since I wouldn't have spotted the lemonade section. Throat was dry from weather so this cured plus hydrated. Waited for the ices to melt into the mixture then indulged in the pulps 'n stuff. I rarely finish any drink but in the end 'twas gone, y'all.Can't go wrong with the fajitas - I enjoy these DIY plates. Cow strips had a healthy pink glow on the centers which is appreciated and I can graze on guac. I have great fondness for chunky guac....more chunks more of its own flavor to savor.Next time (most likely in my 'hood) I'm cullin' for his combination enchiladas. 2 or 3. Ballin' for the 3 - chicken, chicken, cow. Surprisingly the mexican rice wasn't dry. But even if it was I'd meld those carbs with the 'chilada residue - mmmmm.....Let us not forget the genesis of the feed - da chips. When one cracks open the doors of these establishments, the thought of accomplishing the suggested daily calories should be shunned from one's thoughts. I would've escaped with a bag of 'em if I could....fresh, luminous, sexy. Our spirited server was let down when we declined on dessert. If she only knew how I was pulling the limits of my stretchy skinny denim...thank you for the 2\% elastane, jbrand. Now if only I can feel my toes.
The chips are good. Everything else is just okService is never goodI'd rather go to chipotle
Being a Texas native, I had very low expectations for this place, but I was pleasantly surprised. The drinks are solid, and the food is pretty good. I got the sour cream chicken enchiladas, which were only around $10, and they were pretty close to authentic. The portions are generous as well. Given that there aren't a lot of Tex Mex options in the area, I will definitely be back (although I'm eagerly awaiting the arrival of Mi Cocina - it'll be worth the trek to Chevy Chase!).
This place is a great for a couple reasons: Nice menu selection with specials, excellent fresh chips and salsa, can accomodate a group, fantastic outdoor seating and its super clean. This is a large restaurant with a good size patio so if you have a group I would recommend. I recommend the take out as well because they do a nice job boxing it all up and give you a nice portion of chips/sals. Service is average for this area, prices are reasonable, and its near the metro. If they wanted to improve I would say a few drink specials during happy hour would be awesome and better patio service on the side area which always seems to get neglected.
I've been here a few times and everything seems to meet expectation. Note the phrase "meet" expectations and not "exceed".Chips and salsa are served once you are seated. I usually go for lunch and get their lunch special: your choice of meat with hot fluffy tortilla (don't you hate when they give you old and hard tortillas?), small portion of guacamole, rice and beans. For some reason the place is never as crowded as I expect during lunch hours on weekdays, but that's the great part, you never have to wait.The food is what deserves the 4-star. Service is alright, its not bad, but sometimes its a little to get a hold on the server to refill our drinks since they typically only come out to bring out your food and don't really check on us very often.
Really great service. Food was good. I order guacamole for an appetizer and had the (2) soft tacos as my meal. Portion sizes for the meal was very large, tasted good. Will definitely come back and try the fajitas next time and the chocolate empanadas!
Lunch service was sub par - especially considering they weren't very busy, but I thought the food was pretty good. They have a variety of lunch specials to choose from some of which come with fruit as a healthy option. They are popular for Happy Hour because they have margaritas and other delicious drinks where the alcohol doesn't hit you right away.I miss Chevy's $3 frozen margaritas and unbelievable flautas.... Uncle Julios is an ok substitute.
REALLY good Mexican food and superb service!!! Did I say superb service?!!!  The staff says they have to go through weeks of service training to work here and you can tell. Another thing is that food comes out in minutes! Margaritas are awesome and flowing here. Highly recommended.
Went here for dinner with friends on Saturday night. This place is normally busy, but it's also a large restaurant. We arrived about 8:15 pm and were lucky to get seated right away. A server was with us within moments, and our drink and food orders soon followed. I'm not giving Uncle Julio's Rio Grande Cafe more stars for the following reasons: All the hard surfaces in the restaurant make the noise level higher and it's more difficult to have a conversation. Also, the prices are a bit more expensive than the typical Mexican restaurant, and I don't think you get anything more for the added cost. I had the chicken soft taco platter and was overwhelmed with how much lettuce was on it. It wasn't as flavorful as some chicken tacos I've had, but the rice and beans were good.A-ok.
Not really a fan. Most meals are just average but the queso, which is always my favorite thing to order at mexican restaurants, was just aweful. Not to mention a little tiny cup was $7.Overall, overpriced for an average meal.
After looking through my reviews on here, I realized I never wrote one for Uncle Julio's in the Reston Town Center location, so here I am this morning.Last night (Saturday September 15) was perfect weather for sitting outside and their patio was full, so I opted for sitting in the bar. Behind the bar, I recognized Liz from the RTC location. As soon as I sat down, the chips & salsa was already being served. ***Side grammar note - "was" or "were" in the last sentence***. I asked her to change the channel from a college football game no one was watching to the Nationals/Braves baseball game.I ordered the steak & enchilada dinner ($16.25), which is a 6 oz carne asada plus a cheese & onion enchilada. I was amazed how fast my dinner came! I was not amazed how good it was, since it was always good at RTC. My lovely fiancee eventualy joined me from her outing and had the combination enchiladas (2 for $9.95). That also came very fast considering how busy the bar area had become since I showed up.Much thanks to the other 2 servers at the bar, who I didn't get their names unfortunately.
After numerous great encounters with every single staff member (minus one super terrible one, but I'll overlook them because I specifically ask not to be placed in that person's section) I can easily give this Uncle Julio's a good rating!Liz, the wonderful bartender and occasional server is a jewel at this location! Jon P. is a riot and watches over his tables very well...Some people complain about the noise level here, but every single UJ's I've been to has a high level of jubilant noise during the prime times. If noise bothers you, then come later in the night or during lunch time! Geez, do you really think tequila and good Tex Mex are going to be enjoyed quietly!??!?!The chips are salsa are excellent with a spicy chipotle flavor rounding it off. They're served as you sit, so don't overlook them!Food is always mega fast... sometimes too fast.Take out is handled by the bar and is always ready when promised and a great way to enjoy Uncle Julio's at home or in your hotel!Street parking is a pain and the attached garage has no full validation (validated at the hostess stand). Eh. Don't use the garage across the street on the weekends because it has an early closing time.
Good Tex-Mex, wonderful drinks, and awesome service!Having moved here from Texas (land of plentiful delicious Tex-Mex) I tried a lot of Arlington Mexican restaurants. From El Paso Cafe to El Ranchero, I insisted that I would never eat Tex-Mex at a chain so I avoided this place like the plague. Finally, after getting sub-par Tex-Mex everywhere I went I finally tried this place. What a relief! I've tried a few things of the menu and enjoyed all of it. For real. You Tex-Mex snobs like me, please give this a chance!!They have recently changed their menu to include more delicious options...my recommendation? The guacamole/queso combination to start, the vegetables tamales for an entree, and the skinny guava rita to drink.
This is specifically a shout out on the service we received at lunch yesterday. The food was taking a while to come out to us (although we didn't really notice because we were eating the chips and salsa and talking) and three different people came to our table to apologize for the delay and to make sure we were ok. The food is decent, but definitely not authentic mexican by any stretch of the imagination. I do like the food better than Alero though.
It's a decent Spanish chain restaurant thats a bit over priced. Whether you are drinking or eating they do have great complimentary chips and salsa which they make their own. So that's a plus. Depending on the locations the bar area gets really crowded. One great dish is the guadalajara but you can bet it does cost a pretty penny plus its definitely not healthy, but thats probably what makes it good.Would I go back. Yes. I do love the chips and salsa.
This is my favorite place to eat Mexican in the DMV. There food is always fresh, the margaritas are good, and the carne asada is the best that I have ever had anywhere hands down!
I recently moved to the Ballston area and had heard great reviews about this place. My friend and I went over just for drinks before walking over to Willow right next door. We were asked to seat ourselves on the side patio since the main patio was reserved for guests who wanted to dine. We waited for over 10 mins before my friend had to ask someone serving in the main area if we can be helped. I wish we had not asked and walked out that minute! What followed was horrendous customer service and experiencing the wrath of our server who really wanted to be somewhere else.This is what happened:Server (S): Are you drinking?Us (U): Yes?S: (without a smile and quite rudely) What do you want?U: Umm, can we see the menu?S: (curtly) Ok!U: We'll have the sangrias?S: (again completely uninterested in taking our order) Ok! He brings drinks.U: Thanks. Can we get some silverware? And (since we noticed other people were eating chips and salsa) some chips? And can we also have some water?S: Ok!(The sangria was tasty but very light on wine)Brings us chips and silverware and that's it. Never comes back to ask if we want more drinks or if we like something else or we'd like our check. I had to walk back to the host table and ask them for my check who someone else brought to me and apologized for the delay. Also, that server was kind enough to request me to return to me seat. I chose not to because we were tired of waiting for our server.I asked the host if they had a suggestion box because we thought the server was having a really bad day and we had to bear the brunt. She didn't seem interested in knowing what had happened and apologized for the sake of it. I let her know that I'll just write a review on Yelp!I have seen people have bad days and it's okay but this just was ridiculous. I haven't tried their food but I don't think I even want to anymore. I was looking forward to it but service is extremely important to me. And, for them too! They are in an area where there are 100s of other restaurants who do a kickass job at serving people - Willow, for instance!I'm sad that my first Yelp review started off on this sour note but it is my duty of sorts as a foodie to prevent other folks from going through this torture.
I've eaten here several times, over the nearly two decades I've lived in the inner DC suburbs of NoVA. The food has always been competent and consistently decent. Drinks are pretty fair, too.Ate here, again, for the first time in several years. It was a lot noisier than I remember it being. It was noisy to the point that, in order for the person immediately to my right to be able to hear me, I literally had to shout my words. I don't like having to shout over a meal and I don't like not being able to hear myself think. It also seems they/ve moved the interior seating closer together. Being bumped by people at adjacent tables because they've bunched things up too much (and, yet, the walkways to the clumps of seating were rather wider than many restaurants') gets annoying fast - especially when already annoyed by the noise.So, while the food was good, I couldn't help but have the desire to flee the place for someplace less ear-splittingly loud.Don't think I'll be back any time soon
I went here a couple of nights ago with a large group of hungry runners after a track meet. While I understand as a large group we put a lot of demands on the staff, aside from the atmosphere and location, I was underwhelmed in pretty much every aspect of the experience.Our server was friendly and worked very hard, but service was very slow, particularly with getting our drinks. I was also never given or offered any water, which should be a given considering we were a group of sweaty runners. I had two classic margaritas on ice. The margarita itself was nothing to write home about. While the taste and strength were average, it was a really tiny glass (maybe felt smaller b/c of the fact that I was so thirsty!) and was overpriced at $9 a drink.The food was similarly underwhelming. I ordered Chicken Fajitas priced at $16. I wouldn't have been so disappointed in the price if the portion had been larger. The food itself was fine (not spectacular), but the amount of chicken was really small. The server asked if I wanted sour cream and cheese. Assuming it came with the meal, I said yes, only to find on the bill that they charge extra for it. For a $16 meal, cheese and sour cream should be included, I mean come on guys!The atmosphere and location are the restaurant's most redeeming qualities (directly off the metro, lots of outdoor seating abutting Fairfax Dr.).I miss the Mexican restaurants in my hometown of Richmond, where food and drinks are cheap and portion sizes are large. I especially miss the $4 jumbo margarita special at my old standby Mexican spot down there. I'm finding the variety of cheap Mexican joints surprisingly small in the DC metro area.
I've been coming here for 12 years and there have been ups and downs, but my feeling about the restaurant right now is definitely up. I always bristled at the prices of the food, particularly the overpriced alcohol, but recently that has bothered me less as the quality/cost of the food has balanced out (some very tasty and appealing dishes added on the lower end) and I've had a number of enjoyable visits/ experiences in different contexts - with a kid and with friends for dinner, with co-workers for happy hour, and several catering instances where Uncle Julio's has catered work and professional events for us. I had a great time at each of the 3 restaurant visits and really appreciated the quality and taste of the food in the catered events. For us, this is a go-to for outdoor dining again and we're happy to have them here in Ballston.
We've eaten at Uncle Julio's a few times and always enjoyed it. The food is tasty and seems to be about on par with other "Fine Mexican" food in the area, such as Guapo's. I usually go with something basic like "Juanita's Platter" which I thoroughly enjoy. The chips are baked fresh and are very light. The salsa is wonderful too and has a great spice to it. Entree prices, $10-25 are average for the area.It's a pretty big place, but gets crowded quickly on Fri/Sat nights as expected. Even with the crowd, it's usually not more than a 10-15 minute wait.The margarita menu is good. I prefer to have a custom one made with my choice of tequila, either Grand Marnier or Cointreau, and fresh lime juice vs. a mix. The only reason I've knocked a star off the rating is the value you get from the drinks. The margarita's average ~$10 and are served in a typical rocks/old fashioned size glass which is pretty small. They go down easily and you will run your bill up quickly ordering multiple drinks. You may pay more for a drink at another Mexican restaurant (i.e. Guapo's), but they are MUCH larger. Our last visit, for two, was ~$100 (including tip) for 2 drinks and an entree each - no apps or desserts. In the end, we'll continue going to Uncle Julio's for the great atmosphere and tasty food/drinks.
We hit up Uncle Julio's for Happy Hour. It was a miserable fail. First of all, even if there is essentially no one out on the patio, as in my case, they won't let you sit down until your whole party is there - not easy when you have people coming from many different places. Once I cajoled them into letting us take a big table with (gasp) only 4 people present, it took forever to 1) order drinks, and 2) actually receive those drinks. This trend continued throughout the evening such that new arrivals were instructed to order 2 drinks instead of one. Although when one guy actually did order 2x drinks he only got 1! Their happy hour specials aren't much to brag about. I like real HH deals like 1/2 off or buy one/get one...not so much. They knock $2.25 off margaritas (which are notoriously overpriced in the first place) and take $1.xx off beers. I put back a few 'ritas and mojitos then finally switched to beer so I could try to find some actual alcohol content. Meh
Great fajitas and amazing swirl margaritas. really nice staff and bartenders
I used to prefer this place until trying other great Mexican restaurants in the area. The food is pretty good here, but it has decent competition with more pros. The atmosphere here is energetic and lively most of the time, but there is a price for it.Waiting times can be significant, and the waiting area can be crowded. There is a full-bar to wait, but that can get busy as well. The problem is the service as others have mentioned. Most, not all, of the bartenders aren't very attentive. Waiters are sometimes very friendly, but they are often over-burdened or don't give you much attention. This is a good place if you are looking for an atmosphere to energize the night, but if you're looking for a good meal, try El Paso or La Union. You'll get better, faster service with good food for less money.
The food is DELICIOUS here, it's the actually look of the place that throws me off. When you walk into the dining room, it's has a sort of huge cafeteria feel. I don't know why people are hyping up the frozen swirl margarita. It isn't that great. DON'T BELIEVE the hype, but the food is great no what you order.
I asked for a burrito, beans and rice after looking at the menu with a lot of names that meant nothing....waiter said to check out X and it was $18.95, grossly overpriced. I finally found soft tacos, beans and rice for $10.95 BUT! they had the Supreme for $12.95 which I got. Waste of money. The difference was .25 worth of more salad on the side. 2 OZ of beans in another dish! Recommend go someplace else for value. Salsa had sugar in it? Way too mild, aksed to "heat it up" They added dry red pepper. Result? Lousy salsa to start with followed by lousier salsa after. A meal that should have cost $20 for two cost $
As much as I love eating their fajitas as much as I hate it when they serve your food just in a minute or two from the moment you place your order. I do not get what is the rush for because the food might not be cooked to perfection. In more than a visit I had my chicken fajitas undercooked and I got sick one time for few days. Now I always ask to cook my food right because I am actually not in a rush to eat and not ready to b sick again..
Decent food, TERRIBLE service. I mean terrible. I don't say that often about restaurants, because I understand they get busy and often I am not in a hurry. Here the server took a long time to come and say hi to us and get our drinks (water!!!) order. Then the water took ages to come. She took our orders, apps and margaritas, since we were at the patio. The food came relatively quickly, but we haven't had utensils yet. We had to ask for them.Then we had to ask for the small plates.Which again seemed excruciating for the server and took long. The server never checked on us! While she never showed herself to our table and another with a couple, she was constantly stopping by at another table right next to us!!We only got the pork tamales and quesadilla. The portions are huge! Two of us (granted both female) had that for dinner and lunch the day after. Their salsa is good too. It has a taste to it and doesn't remind you of tostitos in a jar.Hope this was an exception and not the norm...
Their chips and salsa make me want to sell my house and move in. They rock. I order them carry out for football games. Chain or not this place is awesome. Swirl margarita, camarones bruchetas, fish tacos, fajitas are great. If you want them to roll you out, get the Guadalajara.
Waited for about fifteen minutes on a Saturday night around 9pm. It was really crowded and super busy. But i didn't mind because i saw they made their own tortilla's FRESH!! We ordered fajita and got to taste the fresh tortilla, it was soo fluffy and warm - godsh my mouth is watering!! We also ordered the enchilada and tamale combo - nothing to write about other then its ok. But def get the fajita's. they were spectacular
Best Mexican food in the DC metro area, as far as I know...After living in CA, I really missed good Mexican after moving to DC, Julio's is the best I've had so far!
Its really a 3.5 stars! I like this place because I can always come here for a good stiff drink in frozen form and some tasty food--I just don't come here often because I eat like a PIG. I like the fajitas, carne asada and who doesn't like free chips and salsa to start?
Love the food here. They have a great deal on carry out platters. The dining room gets a little loud with the open floor. Food is great here! Love the salsa. Beans. Queso.
I went to Uncle Julio's with a few of my girl friends and we had a great time. The service was very good and the food was delicious. I had the chicken enchiladas and loved them. It was a little pricey for a Mexican restaurant. But there is a parking garage attached to the restaurant and they will validate for the parking cost. I went for dinner for 2 hours and only had to pay $2 for parking. Also, the swirl margarita was not very good. I would stick to a regular margarita.
I live right down the street so I've been here way too many times. Maybe it's just my perception, but I think this place has gotten worse over the past couple years. It has always been overpriced for the quality of the food, but was almost always pretty tasty. However, the last few times I've gone it just has been blah for $20-$30 for an entree.I think it's best to stick with Juanita's platter or another traditional mexican dish. They are only about $15 and taste better anyways. The fajitas were average the last couple times I've ordered them.The meat and veggies were way too buttery. Salsa can be good but can also be too peppery. Guac is almost always solid though. It would probably be 4 stars if it wasn't so expensive. Could be 2 stars after you incorporate their prices but I'll go with 3.
love the place. foods are just okay.
I really enjoy eating here. The server staff is normally excellent and the food is always delicious.  My only concern is the number of times my meat comes out user cooked.
It's good, but it's got a chain-y vibe. I think I rather go down the street and get some more authentic latin-style food for less money. However, I do like this place and I come here every so often. The nachos selection is AWESOME.
Lots of fresh, Tex-Mex flavor. I love their green chile sauce on cheese enchiladas, and the warm salsa & thin, crispy tortilla chips. Both were spicy and delicious. They have a limited vegetarian menu, but the cilantro rice and black beans were pretty tasty.
I'm such a PIG and I can't help myself....or at least thats what my wife says about my eating habits. I do not disagree with her at all. I am sure everyone has tried this place if you live in one time or another, but this place is right across the street from my place. Can you say late night take out? Feel like a margarita...run across. Feel like nachos run across. Feel like some awesomely under rated ribs.....dash across.Everyone loves the fajitas....blah blah blah. The camarones brochette AWESOME!!! The costillas EVEN BETTER! I am one to always eat the nachos there...they don't travel well even across the street. Check it out for some great food and good drinks. Cheers and happy eats!
I cannot emphasize enough how sub-par our experience at Rio Grande was.I took my wife and brother-in-law for a meal, having fond memories of its other locations from college. Maybe I liked it because a friend was working there, maybe because I wasn't paying attention to value-for-money, maybe the food was just better five years ago - but this time around I was thoroughly disappointed. First - Tex-Mex is about flavor, portions, simplicity, and value-for-money.Our meal at Rio Grande was bland and damnably expensive (even by Northern Virginia standards). All three of our entrees were cold, lifeless, and devoid of the warm, cheesy, spicy punch you look for in good Tex-Mex. Even the rice and beans arrived cold. $15-$20 per was too much to pay for this stuff. I haven't found my go-to Tex-Mex in the DC area, but I won't go back to Rio Grande.
Went for a late lunch around 1pm on a weekday and the place was packed. Service was friendly and fast. Each table is served with super thin tortilla chips and salsa. The chips were greasy but good. The salsa had huge pieces of tomato that got in the way of dipping. We tried the tortilla soup and fish tacos. Both items were okay. Parking is easy either on the street or in the parking garage in the building.
Good food. The salsa was delicious. They do like their cheese though haha.
For Americanized TexMex this is a pretty good place. The service isn't outstanding, but once you place your order the food gets to you pretty quickly. Their quesadilla's are pretty tasty and their taco's are huge. Highly recommend their brunch menu.
Uncle Julio's is bar none the best Tex-Mex joint in the DC-NOVA region. I'm gonna take a lot of heat for that, but speaking as a native Texan, ain't nuttin' bettah.The key to understanding Tex-Mex is realizing that it's not AUTHENTIC Mexican food. Authentic Mexican joints often feature tortilla soups or different kinds of full-bodied meat like barbacoa or non-ground beef. Uncle Julio's brings the TEX to the MEX and makes it AWESOME. Here, you get AWESOME Mexican rice... not that yellow or jasmine rice found at Los Tios or other knockoff Tex-Mex joints. You get UNAPOLOGETICALLY FAT ENCHILADAS... drenched in cheese and pico. NOMZ TO YA MUTHA.I saw another Yelp reviewer say something about how Uncle Julio's is not "Vegan friendly." Lady, if you're going to Uncle Julio's for some Vegan action, you better take a long look in the mirror because you got problems, yo. There is NOTHING healthy about Uncle Julio's. REVEL IN THIS, my friends. It's a testament to how delicious, fat-soaked Tex-Mex can intoxicate you.Don't let the cheesy menus fool you either: yes, there are some Applebee's-like margarita choices. This cheesiness underlies a solid dining experience with great service and a beautiful patio. If you ever get the chance to have some happy hour cocktails and appetizers here, make sure you do it in the springtime on the patio.
Rio Grande is a go-to spot for my family. We always order lots and lots of margaritas, which are always good here. (Frozen swirls are yum!) I'd recommend getting the guacamole, carne asade or beef fajitas - they are usually great. I think that's all I'd order here though! If your group is going to be extremely loud or you have a lot of a kids, I'd highly recommend coming here. Service is usually really good and it's a great spot for large groups - try to make a reservation, but it can get busy!
Nice lookin place but not very Vegan friendly for a Mexican joint. Many of their sauces are meat based, they add bacon to their beans. Then there's the weird smokey flavored salsa, not your usual fresh tomatoes. The chips are thin (i like) though and freshly made.Value $ sucks, appetizer was skimpy, you pay extra for sour cream? Never heard of such a thing.Cute place for a date, large group you want to impress, however, I prefer going elsewhere to extend my hard earned cash and where my animal pals are spared.
Definitely on the upper-end of 3 stars. I'm not usually one for chains and restaurants that claim to be "Tex-Mex", but Uncle Julio's was a pleasant surprise. The food is actually quite tasty, with cheap prices to accompany it. And the portion sizes are not DC-esque; meaning you actually get a hefty plate of food, which seems to be a thing of the past these days. The warmed, smoky salsa is spot-on, as is the queso and freshly-prepared guacamole (*order the latter extra spicy). The cheese enchiladas, sans onion, with salsa verde or carne are rockin'. Stick to those, as the tamales (heavy-handed on the corn) and beef tacos (lacking true Tex-Mex flavors) leave more to be desired. And as for the drinks, steer clear of the sangria (frozen and on the rocks) and the strawberry margarita (way to sweet) and just stick with the classic marg on the rocks.It's actually a great place for a group outing - huge space and lots of menu items for the picky and those who will love anything.
My wife and I went to Uncle Julio's for happy hour to have a margarita. We were greeted by a bartender who was nice, but was trying to up-sell us on about three points of our order. We thought we ordered two classic margaritas. We thought these were the regular margaritas on the rocks with salt. Unfortunately, that is not the case. When I got the bill, it was $18. In my previous experiences there, the hh margaritas were around $6.50. At any rate, I felt I was taken advantage of and will never return. Their food is just OK anyway.
The bartender conveniently forgot it was happy hour, charged me full price and tried to steal my change. I quickly brought it to the attention of the manager, when the guy next to me at the bar was told that all drinks were half price. it isn't about the money, but the lack of honesty. I know times are hard, but really ?!?! You don't have to hustle and steal to make tips. I'm actually really generous.  If you go, get a receipt, check your tab often, and count your change. The food and service here is usually great for me. This put a damper on my opinion.
They have some pretty good lunch specials, all under $15. Their chicken or beef fajitas are served sizzling on a hot plate with rice, beans, and guacamole. The chicken is cooked right and very juicy and the beef is usually pretty tender. Their chipotle salmon is also very good! I like the sauce, corn and the rice with parsley. This is a great spot to just sit under the colorful umbrellas and people watch when the weather is nice out. The service is great, they have never messed up our group orders, and trust me, we go there A LOT, maybe a little too much even =)
I love this place. I always come here for the steak fajitas and sometimes I get it with the shrimp. I love the steak its sooooo good and the cilantro rice is awesome. The staff is also great. The manager came the first time I ate here and he gave us free desert (sopapillas) which are delicious. The location is tricky but just park in the garage and bring your ticket to the hostess and they will stamp it for you.
I went to Uncle Julio's with my sister and her boyfriend. I had the vegetable fajita combination with beef, which was very good. My sister and her bf SHARED the Guadalajara and they seemed to enjoy it. We split a cajeta for dessert, and I remember it was under $5. It was pretty good.My sister and I both had ice water while bf had one beer. Our total? $78.19!! That did include tip and I think I left $12, but there is no way that should cost $66. The food was very good, but so are a dozen other Mexican joints that cost literally half as much. Not worth it at all, and I wish I hadn't wasted my money.
Got to try this location during a recent trip back to Wash DCPatio! Great service (crowded, of course, but we beat dinner rush on Friday and had a great time).Service is strong, as usual. Meals are expensive, but gets you a good waiters.Menu is strong across the board. Make sure you try this place.
Always good! Can get busy at peak times. Great drinks, salsa and the best fajitas!
Uncle Julio's is the epitome of ok, but over-priced Mexican food. It's the Mexican Macaroni Grill or Bonefish. The chips are fresh and salsa has a smoky flavor. The fajitas are good, but at almost $20, it's a lot to spend for some strips of cheap meat, peppers, and onions. The margaritas here are done well and include quite a few options. The decorations are fairly generic. Outdoor seating seems to be popular and is always a plus. For better food at a cheaper price, try La Union on Wilson Blvd.
Great food at a great price. The chile con queso is a great starter. Sharing the fajitas is a good idea. It's great for groups and outdoor dining. I would go back again if Chevy's didn't have a 7 day a week happy hour!
Recession Smeshion! Forget the recession, these folks have jacked up their prices over the past year. I enjoy the food but the price hikes give me pause on whether I will dine there as frequently as I once did (2-3 per month over many years). I must share that the chocolate empanada is totally awesome. Really totally. Slightly warmed and melted chocolate inside of a soft and lovely flour dough empanada. Photo attached of a recent serving.
My boyfriend & I ended up eating dinner here yesterday purely by chance. It was our first time at Reston Town Center & after strolling around there we decided to give Uncle Julio's a shot, esp since it claimed to have "Fine Mexican Food"... little did we know that it was false advertising... Now neither me nor my boyfriend are tex-mex experts but we have tired plenty of tex-mex restaurants and I have to say that this was by far the worst food we've ever consumed!To start off the salsa was served 'just took out the fridge' cold & didn't have much layers of taste except for the slight smoky flavor, the chips were probably the only item that was decent. When asked if we could get the salsa warm or at least room temp, the waitress replied "its not fresh since its Sunday today & we don't have an oven to warm it up so I don't think there's anything we can do to with the salsa". Needless to say we were quite disappointed with the service & food already!!!We ordered the veggie tamales for appetizer, not only were they very bland they were also dry with no corn taste & not much veggies. The only thing that sorta helped the tamales was the cotija cheese which was sparingly sprinkled on them. The spicy sour cream was non-existent!The entree I got was the fish tacos. The tilapia was also completely bland, not even salt was present which was very disappointing... the cilantro rice was stale & dry, the spicy black beans were spicy but had more tomatoes than black beans. My boyfriend got the honey chipotle salmon which was supposed to have a honey chipotle glaze on it but really didn't... it was very very dry & overcooked. The corn, black bean & cilantro rice was undercooked & the pineapple pico de gallo didn't quite tie in with the salmon & rice...We didn't get any dessert because frankly we didn't want any more disappointments & sadly we left from there paying way too much for not even decent food, not to mention still hungry!! I think its safe to say that we will not be back ever & we sure won't be recommending this place to anyone!
Parking was a challenge. Obviiously a popular place based on the crowds. Obligatory chips and salsa were average. Fajitas were awesome, but not a lot of food for the price. All in all, I was pleased with the meal, not pleased with what it cost.
My extensive research into Tex-Mex restaurants has led me to two conclusions:1) Outside of pizza, Tex-Mex is *the* most kid-friendly cuisine of all time. Every Tex-Mex joint I've been to has been packed to the gills -- half the patrons kids under 10 -- and loud as all get-out as a result. 2) A Tex-Mex chain is a Tex-Mex chain is a Tex-Mex chain. Swirl margs? Check. Eight types of fajita combos? Check. Fried ice cream? Check.Friends and I have been coming to Rio Grande for longer than I care to reveal, and this place has done little to disabuse me of my Tex-Mex theories. It's loud, crowded, staffed by cordial, efficient robo-teens, and hits all the Tex-Mex whistles and bells in the food and bev department. But -- they do make their own tortillas on-site. Their house salsa is spicy and smoky. Their fajita fixings are fresh and high quality. And you can get frogs legs here (husband would want me to point this out to you). However -- it's pricier than other chains in the area. Parking is a hassle unless you pay for a garage. And they don't take reservations, so you might have a looooong wait (you *can* call ahead, tho).I dunno, you decide. Maybe I'll see you there sometime, hangin' with my high school crew.
Let me say this - if there is a real Uncle Julio, can he please adopt me so I can be invited to all the family gatherings? My Hubbster is a DC native and every once in a while he will surprise me with a new place. I made the comment one day last week that I hadn't had good authentic Mexican food in a while {since I was last in Texas}. Well next thing I know we (Hubbster, the kids and I) are heading out. We arrived and the hosts were friendly after they finished their conversation. The four of us were seated. One thing about me I hate to be seated in high traffic areas because I am the one people bump no matter how much space there is or perceived to be space but there were two large parties so seating was limited.Before we were settled in our seats we were brought fresh chips and salsa. Fresh and delicious thin crispy chips. The salsa was a tad watery for my taste. I prefer my salsa to be hardier.We ordered drinks, I had the Swirl (Frozen Margarita layered with home-made frozen Sangria) on the recommendation of the server and the Hubbster. The Hubbster let us look at the menu but while we thought we were deciding he said we were ordering the Plato Gordo{ A platter full of Uncle Julio's famous mesquite grilled favorites. Marinated beef and chicken fajitas, slow smoked pork ribs and camarones brochette. Served with rice, frijoles a la charra, pico de gallo, fresh guacamole and warm flour tortillas. Serving Sizes 2-3, 4}We ordered a queso but it arrived a few moments before the food so it sat basically untouched.I thought the best part of the night was to be the camarones brochette or bacon wrapped shrimp but I quickly changed my mind after the first bite of the ribs. Did I mention that I really love the ribs! We ate until we were stuffed and still had plenty left over.The interior was beautiful, well except for the tables, chairs, and various stuffed animal heads sticking out of the wall at random and unexplained places. Let me rephrase that - I loved the pottery and platters that festooned the walls and alcoves. The kids enjoyed everything and are waiting for our next trip. I could have mine as takeout and be satisfied.
3.5 stars.Pros- You get to watch some guy making fresh tortillas when you first walk in. Fun!!!- Tortilla chips are the thin kind (love 'em), the salsa is very unique and peppery, and the queso dip has chunks of veggie (also loved). We ate 3 baskets between three of us.   ...I probably ate 2 of them, on second thought.- If you say it's your first time, you get a complimentary basket of sopapillas!!! MADE. MY. DAY.- I would actually put the ceviche I ordered in the 'pros' ...it was different because of the addition of tomatoes...but I liked the flavor of it. Pretty delicious. It obviously didn't get served with sweet potato or corn, though, considering the whole Mexican restaurant thing...Cons (ish)- Decor was kinda confusing--I thought I was trapped in a hardcore hunter's log cabin with deer heads hanging everywhere. Lighting was weird, too. The art on the wall was interesting to look at though.- Not very 'authentic' Mexican at all... in fact, since they had it on the menu, I got the ceviche like a noob foreigner (because I didnt feel like ingesting carbs. But that's a complete lie because i had approximately 2 baskets of chips and 8,000 sopapillas drenched in honey)Take my review with a grain of salt because I DEFINITELY bit into a jalapeno before starting my meal... that sucker was fresh and SPICY. (Pro for Uncle Julio) But I AM basing my rating off my friends' opinions of their dishes, too. :)
Uncle Julio's is a Dallas/Fort Worth area chain and the only place I found while living in the DC Metro area to get authentic Tex/Mex. That said, really the only things I like there are the beef fajitas and the queso. Their rice and beans aren't that great. I like the chips and salsa but I like thin chips.There are better places to eat Tex-Mex in Texas, but if you are in the DC area and just have to have a fajita fix, this is where to go.
Whenever I'm in the Fairfax area and the weather is nice, Uncle Julio's is my go-to place for drinks when I want to sit outside. They give you chips and salsa to munch on. I've never actually eaten here. This place is great for relaxing outside on the patio. It's seat yourself (outside), so go ahead, walk into the outdoor seating and plop down at a table. Happy hour starts at 4:30 on weekdays - specials are about 30\% off drinks. Their frozen drinks are pretty good and I really like their mojitos.
My friend and I ate here last night for the first time, and it has now been added to one of the worst food experiences I've had in my life. Both of us felt sick from just the complementary chips and salsa alone (might as well have brought a bag of Tostitos, they would have had more flavor). The dinner entrees were equally, if not more, disgusting. To go into detail, the chips were bland, generic, and thin. The black salsa tasted flavorless and as though it had been sitting out for days. My dinner plate, the vegetable platter, had zero flavor. For instance, it comes with a few red potatoes - they literally served them borderline raw and with zero seasoning. My friend's dinner plate, chicken enchiladas (which were slimy), made him physically ill. This is a warning to anyone out there who values well-cooked, flavorful food: do not eat here!As for the service, it was equally lacking. Our waiter came by our table roughly three times, and in between those times he was literally no where to be found, sometimes for up to twenty minutes.
This restaurant has a great atmosphere. Lively, roomy, bustling, and a interesting place. Unfortunately, I wish their food was as interesting. I ordered a platter so I had a chance to taste their soft taco, enchilada, and one other chile wrap that I don't care to remember the name of.The food was bland, tasteless, and lacking. I've had more flavor come out of the #2 at Taco Bell, which shouldn't be that hard to beat. Then again, a steak burrito from Taco Bell is good but should be beatable. The only saving grace here was their Baja Gold, a Corona served as a margarita.This is an priced place, but made worse by the fact that their food was the equivalent of rubbing your tongue across paper. Actually, even simple plain white paper had more flavor. Sadly, they had great service, good atmosphere, but all that goes down the drain when the food can't compare.
I have been here several times. On our recent visit, we tried the cadillac fajitas and it was excellent. Definitely a pretty good place for Tex-Mex.
I always plan a detour to this place when I'm heading through DC. Food is awesome, margaritas are fantastic, and service is great. Clean place, good location (especially if the weather allows you to sit outside), and just a few steps from the Ballston Metro stop if you want to avoid driving and parking altogether. Great place!
I love their salsa, love their enchiladas, love their tamales. I never leave this place without feeling like a greasy sack of overeating shame.
This is a "pretty good" place. I didn't find it any more or less authentic or more or less quality than Chevy's, but all in all it was decent quality food with large portions and good service.
Was at Uncle Julios last night for fajitas (my favorite menu item is the Guadalajara but I wasn't hungry enough last night to finish on my own), they do serve the better beef (steak) fajitas in the area. Was with a few friends so we got "fajitas for 3", GOOD LAWD was that a lot of food.... We probably would've been good with the 2 person platter but the extras made for a good doggy bag. Service was okay... we were on the patio and it looked like our server had a lot of other tables so I'll blame his being in the weeds on his bosses. No margaritas last night which is out of the norm for me... I'll be back and will update.
I used to live in Ballston and knew this place well. I was happy to see that things hadn't changed much, which means portions are large, food is tasty enough, and the frozen swirl margaritas still come with electric pink stirrers in the shape of a flamingo wearing a sombrero. What more do you need in life?? One thing that keeps me coming back here is the fact that they make their own tortillas. Granted, these are your Mexican grandmother's tortillas that are rolled into a ball and pressed flat--they're make a from a machine spitting them out--but they're still good! I usually get one of the lunch specials (lunch is served until 4:00) that are reasonably priced because everything else is on the pricier side. My friend wanted a carne asada steak with a side of ribs. There was a combo plate that could have sufficed, but when the bill came it was the $20 asada platter with a $10 side of ribs. I guess we should have been a little more specific when ordering. One thing that does need to be said for this place is about their happy hours. Grab a lovely margarita, go sit outside on their patio, and what's this? A meltdown? I don't know what it is, but sure I'll have one! When ordering a drink you can ask for an extra floater shot on top, and during happy hour the prices are something like half of what they normally charge. Arriba, abajo, al centro al dentro!
I've had the chance to eat at the Rio Grande several times now and though it's not the most authentic of Mexican restaurants, it is a nice - but loud - place to eat.Bottom line up front: the food is good. Not great, but well above that of the megachain Mexican restaurants (On the Border, Chi-Chi's, etc.). At this location, the waitstaff is also very friendly and helpful (a colleague was there for the first time; waiter took the time to explain the whole menu, something I don't see often enough at large restaurants).What downs the place, though is the the noise level and the crowds. Meaning, a lot. Obviously while that's a sign the place is popular, not so much when you're waiting a while for a table or are squished in sardine-style because of the sheer number of people inside. This is even worse during winter, though an addition to their outdoor seating during milder weather has helped.All in all, a nice place to eat. Just avoid during busy periods unless you're willing to wait.
We hopped out here on our trip because we were hungry and the wait downtown for everywhere was over an hour...our first night in and we had no reservations. Great quick meal and was close to the metro line for a quick trip there and back.
Always reliable, fast, fresh, good service and tasty Tex-Mex plates that never go wrong. Not cheap (two soft shell tacos w/ sides - $18.95) but a quality standby. Decent patio and bar dining options. Family friendly.
Come here for lunch every now and again. The free chips and salsa are warm and fresh. Lots of lunch specials, (personally I get the Sonora platter lunch: taco, enchilada, and tamale for 10 bucks, the el dorado or their fajitas are popular too). Even when it's busy during lunch, the wait is reasonable. More like a 4.2-4.5 but I bumped it up to a 5 since I've always had a good experience here and the prices are great.
I've been to the Uncle Julios / Rio Grande in Ballston multiple times for lunch with co-workers, and also went to the one in Richmond (when it was around) a ton for lunch too.Short and sweet: I love the chicken fajitas and the swirl frozen margaritas are awesome. (margarita w/ sangria, or other flavors)I think the tex mex food is pretty good here. The sides are good and the menu is varied. The ingredients seem pretty fresh. It's pretty basic tex mex, though, so if you're partial to a specific restaurant I'm not sure this will sway you. The decor is pretty much what you would expect--lots of stuff on the walls, bright colors, etc. The service depends on who you get, especially during the work week lunchtime crowd. It can be pretty busy and kind of loud on a weekday, though.Overall--I rounded up my rating to a 4 because of my love of the frozen margarita swirls and the fajitas.
Bad reviews be damned! This is one of the most popular restaurants in Fairfax Corner, and they don't take reservations. Call an hour ahead, because there will be at least an hour's wait. Food? If you're looking for pure heat/spice and cheap Mexican food, head on down to Taco Bell. I hear they're open until midnight or later. The food is not drowned in spice, you can actually taste the quality of the meat, and the mesquite. The salsa doesn't pack heat, but instead you can taste all the different herbs and peppers. It's a brownish color, and the chips are light and thin and crispy. The margaritas are to die for, I'm a Patron lover myself... Staff has always been courteous to me, and I go at least 3x a month on Saturdays.I love Mexican food. I have been spoiled on good Mexican food in Southern California with the little mom & pop shops that have homemade recipes in their kitchen, and this place is the closest in DC that I can get. It really is authentic, and upscale. Maybe I'll catch you there sometime!
Have driven by this place numerous times and was never interested as it is not really my first choice for type of food. 2 nights ago a friend had her birthday party there so of course I went and was pleasantly surprised. It was a good way to start the night off with some food food and some drinks.For food I ended up sharing the Juanita's platter with one of my friends. As I said I am not big into this kind of food but it was all good. It filled both of us up and being better than I expected. Everyone's food whether it was fish tacos or steak fajitas was demolished. I think one of my friends even licked his plate clean he liked it so much. If this is your kind of food, definitely go. All of us were pleased even myself which I didn't expect. Also for the birthday girl they brought her some sort of dessert that everyone loved but I was too full to even try.Drinks: My friend recommend I try the swirl margarita, which is very far from my typical drink. She is a bartender and knows what I like so of course I took her advice. It was very unique, tasted like a frozen margarita mixed with sangria (may be exactly that but I didn't really look to see what was in it or care to ask). Even though it is not something I would typically order I liked it. She loved hers though......even stole a few sips of mine when I went outside to smoke. It seemed to go very well with the food though.The server wasn't horrible or unfriendly but didn't seem to show much interest in us. Maybe it was because we got to the party a little late or because it was somewhat busy. Average service really. Not great but not bad. So if you like Tex-Mex give this place a try.
I have no Yelp Friends who have been here. Let's keep it that way! The world's worst chips I've ever encountered in a Mexican restaurant outside of Asia. Paper thin and tasteless. With my pork tamales I kept the salsa from the chips - no spice to it - and was also brought a salsa sauce filled with ground beef pieces - also no spice to it. Only after requesting hot sauce was I able to get any kick from the salsas. Really lame. This is what suburbia wants - nice atmosphere, very friendly and responsive wait staff, a complete menu at reasonable price, and NOTHING WITH ANY TASTE TO IT. It's my own fault. No one expects decent Mexican food in Arlington Virgina. And, let me tell you, no one gets it.
Brunch, brunch and more brunch. My favorite spot for it. Migas or Enchiladas Norteo are a must have. Through in unending chips and roasted tomato salsa and you have a pure winner after getting up late on a Sunday only to found out that you have nothing in the house and your stomach won't stop telling you how hungry it is.
Consistently good mexican food. Very loud - bad for business lunches, good for taking kids.
AWFUL.Why do people go here? Food is meh, Service is terrible!If I ask for a side of guacamole, and you plan on bringing me the world's smallest cup, please inform me that my $5 lunch will have a $7 surcharge for the worlds smallest portion of guacamole.
They get high-marks for service, atmosphere, and food quality... but overall value is definitely 5-stars here.After growing up in Dallas, Tx and be a transplant to North Arlington, I can say with the utmost confidence that Rio Grande is very authentic tex-mex. In fact, it's the only tex-mex restaurant I've found in the area.Understand this. If you are from Texas and enjoy tex-mex food, ignore the other comments about the food and focus in on what I've come to understand about the locals taste for mexican food. They cannot distinguish South American food, Mexican food, New Mexican food, from Tex-mex food. It's all the same to them. In fact, they prefer their food bland in the nothern virginia area and most do not prefer authentic tex-mex because it is too spicy for them.If you're from Texas, and from Dallas like I am, you'll remember there are several Uncle Julio's restaurants around the area. And, I believe they have their roots in Dallas, Texas. So, it's really as authentic as it gets around here. Now, it's no Pappasito's... but not many restaurants are. But, if you want a truly authentic tex-mex meal, just like you're sitting down at a texas cantina, head on over to Rio Grande and you want be disappointed that you did.
Food is only average, but service is atrocious. My first time here, I came with a large group for 5 May. An hour after we placed our orders, still no sign of the food. After repeated warnings, we all got up and walked out. There was no explanation offered by the staff as to why our order was not filled. We even told them to just bring the dishes out as they were done, but still nothing.So for some reason, I went back a few months later to see if it was any better. Although this time we actually got food, I learned that we really didn't miss much by not getting our lunch the first time. Service was slow and generally incompetent the second time around as well. One of my friends asked for hot sauce, and they brought salsa. Don't bother.
I went once and doubt if I'll go back. The service was very good, the chips and salsa were fine. The rice and beans were way way too salty. I ordered the combo with shrimp and fajitas...shrimp tasted like it had been frozen alongside an old carp. The margaritas were very good.
I love Rio Grande...its by far the best Tex-mex I've ever tasted. I've never been disappointed with the food or drinks. I think it's a bit on the pricey side but it's worth it
I've eaten here twice, and had drinks there more often than I'd care to. Both times I got the vegetarian fajitas, both time they made me sick. One possible culprit is that apparently they cook their tortilla chips in lard (when I've asked there, they say they're cooked in vegetable oil, a friend of a friend works there and says "they routinely lie about this. they are cooked in lard, which is why they coat the roof of your mouth in oil in an unusual way") and I'm not used to digesting it. The food is standard Mexican-style American food, but (in my case) it makes you sick as a bonus.The little bar area is crowded and loud, although service is decent. Not much in the way of exciting beers, but I give them points for at least serving some Mexican beer.
This place was delicious; however it took a really long time to get our check. I went here on a friday night, there was a wait, and it looked pretty busy but luckily the people I was meeting had arrived early and already had a seat. The waiter was friendly and took our drink and food orders quickly. Plus the food arrived fast. I had the enchiladas; one chicken and one cheese but I thought they were really good. I don't drink but my friend got the "swirl" and was super happy with it. Additionally, since we were "new" or maybe they had extras.. who knows... but we received complimentary sopapillas. They were incredibly tasty and came with honey for dipping. Nice touch and pretty much makes up for the fact that after that it took a long time to get the checkThe only reason I'm giving them a four and not a five is because after we were finished it took a good thirty minutes to get the check. On the other hand it was so nice not to be rushed as it was quite busy. I'll still go back but hopefully next time they'll leave the check or come around again after the desert so I don't have to wave the person down.
Service was decent, food was good but I think it cost a bit too much.
Best service I've experienced in years!We walked in on Sat afternoon - no wait. We were seated immediately and our server greeted us right away. We placed our drink orders and he was back in a jiff with the drinks. He asked us if it was our first time dining there and it was, so we let him know.I ordered the fajitas, which were great. My husband ordered some sort of taco dish, which he also enjoyed (I know this because he kept bringing up how good those tacos were within the next 48 hours). The server was very attentive, always clearing the finished plates and re-filling our drinks. Anyways, as we were getting ready to pay the bill, the server came back and said he had a surprise for us and that we couldn't leave just yet. Right then, the manager came over with a piping hot plate of these Sopapillas - hot pastry puffs sprinkled with powdered sugar with a honey dipping sauce - and told us that because this was our first time dining with them, they wanted to share their appreciation with this free dessert.... which was AMAZINGLY delicious. I couldn't believe how courteous and customer-oriented this restaurant was. I feel like I haven't experienced this kind of service in a very long time. As a result, we will definitely be back and we will be sure to tell all of our friends about this place, as well!
We have eaten here at least once a month for 5+ years. Always delicious and although sometimes the wait may be long (Fri and Sat nights) the food always comes out fast. Great place to go when you have friends or family in town. Margs are awesome. The quesadillas appetizers are more than enough for a full meal. If you're looking for somewhere fun and consistently delicious head to Uncle Julio's aka Rio Grande
Great fajitas, and excellent margaritas! Will definitely visit again.
Best Mex food in town. This place has a very high level of quality control. The salsa is awesome.
I liked this place. It reminded me of Lauriol Plaza, Cactus Cantina, and Guapo's. The fajitas were worth the hype, as was the carne asada. Both were tender and well-seasoned. The chips and salsa may have been my favorite in the DC area so far - the salsa had a nice smokey chipotle flavor and was surprisingly spicy. Our waiter was Johnny on-the-spot with chip and salsa refills. The guac was also delicious - I know people say this about every Mexican restaurant, but it really was extraordinarily good here.
Just checked this spot out for lunch with some co-workers...pretty busy...sat us immediately...food was prepared quickly...I ordered the fish tacos...nicely done...the salsa is really good as well...
about 15 years ago, i loved coming to rio grande cafe, mostly for their cold fruity alcoholic drinks. after one or two of those, i probably would eat paint chips and be happy. the food was ok, but i was really there for the drinks.fast forward to today -- i'm a mom with two kids. we figured we were bored with our usual places and we decided to visit rio grande. i decided against the cold fruity drinks; it's a school night, you know. ;-) the chips were very fresh. the guacamole was a little weird, as there was a solid piece of avocado underneath the guac. in fact, there wasn't a lot of guac for dipping; mostly, it was a honking hunk of avocado. the kids were a bit frustrated in their dipping efforts, and frankly, so was i. move on to entrees. my grilled chicken salad was ok, though the chicken seemed rather salty. the husband was lukewarm on his grilled beef salad. my kids, not picky eaters (they eat vietnamese, indian, and other foods from around the world), both turned up their noses at the kids meals. the refried beans were a bit too oniony; the mexican rice was meh, and the beef tacos were apparently too spiced for their palates. considering the crowd eating kids meals, i am a little surprised they didn't lower the level of spicing; it wasn't hot-spicy, but it was a bit overwhelmingly spiced for them.in short, i wonder whether those cold fruity alcoholic bevvies made the food more palatable back in the day? not a bad place to go, but there are far better choices locally.
I ordered Take Out last night from this restaurant. I live 1 mile from here, I ordered my food and I was told it would take 15 minutes to be ready. We arrived at the restaurant 15 minutes later and we were told it would be a little bit longer which turned into another 15/20 minutes. I figured at least we would have fresh HOT food. By the time we got home tore open the box (which was literally 5-7 minutes later) our food was ICE cold! It was like they made us wait an extra 15 minutes while the food sat there instead of being packed up. It blows my mind how cold this food really was. And I mean COLD!!! I'm soooo annoyed and disappointed by this that I will NEVER eat here again. I will instead take the 10 minute drive to Wesley Heights to eat at Cactus Cantina.
This place is good, I always get the chicken fajitas and they have always been delicious. It is pleasant to sit out on the patio on a nice day and people-watch and enjoy some drinks, chips and salsa. The other night we did have a tricky waiter though, who asked if we wanted chips and guacamole in such a way that I believed the guacamole was free. It was not. And then he asked if I wanted sour cream with my fajitas after I said I didn't want any beans. The way he asked led me to believe that the sour cream was part of the dish (plus at every other tex mex place I've been sour cream comes as part of the dish). Sour cream was charged to me on the bill. This was a little surprising to me though I had been drinking for a while beforehand so maybe I was just a little more gullible than usual. But I thought he was very clever/sneaky about it. While the food is great, it is expensive, and as noted above, they charge for things like SOUR CREAM! That doesn't make any sense to me. But other than that, it is a great atmosphere out on the patio and I like the drinks.
This place is huge but it also very popular, so it gets crowded and loud.They don't take reservations. However, they do let you call ahead and put your name on the waitlist. Then when you arrive, it is as if you checked in when you called. On weekends, I always call ahead and put my name on the waitlist as I leave my house.The free salsa and chips are excellent. I usually get the chicken fajitas. They are huge and very good. The tortillas are made on site. Be forewarned that sour cream and cheese cost extra. They don't warn you of this.They also have some healthy options. When I am trying to eat healthy, I get the mesquite grilled salmon. It is okay but not great.The swirl margaritas are good. For dessert, I recommend the flan.They have lots of outdoor seating. Service is good.There is parking underneath the building. Rio Grande will validate your parking. You still have to pay but it is a reduced fare.
The veggie Tamales are really good...
Stellar Mexican cuisine! Favorite restaurant in Ballston. The roasted salsa is so fresh, the chips are so salty and delish! The restaurant itself has superb customer service and such a fun ambiance! Whether you are going to enjoy a margarita for happy hour, or have a sit down meal, they will take care of you! My faves are the veggie fajitas, and the carne asada! Can't forgot the sopapillas for dessert!
When I lived in Arlington, I LOVED coming here for their frozen drinks. They have their signature - the swirl - half frozen margarita, half frozen sangria. It's delicious and I don't usually like margaritas. Their queso and chips and salsa are great! Also, they have some delicious apps - I especially recommend the chicken tamales - chicken wrapped in a cornbread like case. They're by far my favorite thing here. Great outdoor seating, especially with the frozen drinks in the summer. As for their entrees - here's where they got the 1 star reduction.They are a little pricey for my taste. I'd rather go to Chevy's for a meal then overspend here.Also, their happy hour specials aren't a significant difference from their original drink prices. One problem we also had was one bad experience (though it was only one of many visits) - we arrived at 4:30 (when their happy hour starts) according to our cell phones. We even specifically waited outside until it became 4:30 to get the happy hour discount. When we got our check, we were charged full price for our first drinks. We told them we had specifically waited until our cell phones said 4:30 before coming in. The waiter brought out his manager who said their computers said 4:20. I had to wonder if their clock was purposely set back to delay their happy hour. The manager apologized and gave us the happy hour price, but wanted us to understand it wasn't the waiter's fault. That's fine, but you don't need to tell the customer's why you think they were wrong in my opinion. I've worked customer service, even I know that.Definitely check this place out - do what my boyfriend and I did - go get a few drinks, have their free chips and salsa (maybe buy a bowl of queso) and share the tamales. Just filling enough without spending a lot of money.
Good quality Tex Mex, good service, a bit noisy. We had brunch on this visit, and the Chilequiles and Enchiladas were very good.  Easy walk from Ballston Metro / Mall area. Large place, we always get seated fast.
We came on the recommendation of a friend ... who loves it so much that, as someone who lives abroad and returns to DC only once a year, she remembered to tell us during a conversation in Africa that Uncle Julio's is an Arlington establishment that should not be missed.First of all, it has outdoor seating, and a decent amount of it. While we waited for our outdoor spot, we popped up to the bar for drinks and sat in another outdoor section with our margaritas. We were there on a warm Sunday night.But we didn't have to wait long - I wasn't even halfway through my salt when we were escorted to our table. Upon being seated, we were immediately served chips and salsa. Thumbs up.Our server was friendly and knowledgeable, describing dishes and warning us about the size of the side of cheese and sour cream (one of the reasons Julio's doesn't get a fifth star -- what place serves fajitas without complimentary sides of sour cream and cheese?!!) The tortillas were soft and warm and not too floury. The rice was, well, Mexican rice, I guess - nothing special. The black beans were pretty tasty, served with hunks of sausage. The chicken was absolutely scrumptious and, since the serving was HUGE, made for a delicious lunch the next day.My fiance chowed down on Juanita's Platter. I think he liked it because I only got a couple bites. The tamale was YUM.I'd stick to the margaritas though over their signature frozen margarita and sangria swirl.
You know I've been here a few times and I've never been impressed. They tend to be super packed though, so other people must like 'em. Being super packed though tends to lower the service you get, and the waiters here tend to ignore you. Plus the food just isn't great. I always try and order something that they claim is spicy and my food always comes out quite bland. I have asked a couple of times for some tapatios or some other type of hot sauce but all they say they have is tabasco sauce. Is it too hard to have a couple bottles of a real mexican hot sauce?
If you like greasy, saturated, cheap ingredients and poorly made overpriced Mexican food with tiny and pricey drinks then this is your kind of place. I would say it is on par with Alero's and Lauriol Plaza but the queso dip and margaritas are better at Lauriol. People seem to like the ambience on the patio.
I've been here many many times, just haven't been around to review it. Gotta give it up to this place...everything is great...chips...salsa...fajitas, but trust me on the fajitas.
Horrible service throughout - starting with hostess upset about the prospect of a take-out order, then our waiter who arrived late and didn't care much about our being there. Food was mediocre. The fast food restaurant Baja Fresh serves better salsa. Loud environment due to bad acoustics, at least in the area I was sitting. For better mexican food, head to a the nearby mall.
I was a little suspicious of this place in the beginning since it's a chain. But the food and drinks turned out to be really good.We ordered their regular margaritas with salt and they were tasty. Our combination fajitas with shrimps, beef and chicken were also really delicious and filling.It helps that the restaurant is in my neighborhood but I can say that I will come back regularly for a nice, cozy meal.
I'm writing to dispel some of the comparisons of this place to a chain restaurant, and questions about its authenticity. First off, the quality is orders of magnitude better than what you get at a Chilis/Chevys/On The Border type place. Food is certainly much fresher, never seems frozen, and tortillas and chips are made in house. The only real similarity is with the decor. Also, this restaurant currently has locations in only 5 metro areas around the country.If you are looking for authentic Mexican food, this is the wrong place to come. If you are looking for authentic Tex-Mex food (it's called Rio-Grande, after all!), it is a superb choice. Sure, you're not going find goat tacos and horchata here, but the food is consistently good and consistent with the types of mainstream Mexican places you'd find in Texas.My fiancee and I discovered this place while were were interning in Dallas, TX during college and were happy to see that they had locations in the D.C. area. I don't think we've ever left here disappointed.
This is the chainiest of all restaurants I've review so far, but I have to include this place because they always, always deliver. For this they get a solid 3.5 stars from me. Most likely an expert method in using salt and butter, this place always provides consistently tasty and well prepared food every time I go. Out of all the other chains in the same market for customers, this is the only place I'll actually look forward to going to.
I've been out to Uncle Julio's 3 times now; one time was only to drink at the bar. I wish I could give Uncle Julio's 4 stars, but it's just not like Guapo's in Shirlington! The margaritas are clearly made from a mix, so they really aren't the best. The queso is second best too. I did really enjoying eating outside, people watching and our funny waiter. The bar area is fun too if you go on a Friday night.
This place is delicious! The chips are extremely addicting so be careful, if you eat too many it will be hard for you to finish your meal. I love love love their queso dip for the chips and their spinach quesedillas. YUM! Don't forget the swirly frozen margarita as well. Man, I'm salivating just thinking about all this. We've kind of done a mini-tour of Mexican places in Arlington and although this is a chain, I'm a big, big fan.
As memory of my fainting incident at UJ's fades, I find myself regarding this place more and more fondly. Last Saturday, what with the amazing weather, I knew just what it needed: some Mexican and a margarita on the patio at UJ's. Went with a few friends and of course all of Arlington had the same idea. We were quoted about an hour wait time, but decided to stick it out. While sitting around outside (there's no good place to wait inside really unless you want to hang at the bar), we noticed servers running trays of chips and salsa out to other parties waiting. We figured we'd have to make a point to order some so we didn't bother, but to our surprise, we were approached and asked if we'd like some chips and salsa while we waited. Very nice gesture.We finally got our seat on the patio and had great service (of course, i can't remember our server's name). While ordering I was pleased to learn that the enchiladas, etc, can be topped with a vegetarian red sauce rather than the meat sauce, which I don't really like in the first place. You can also swap the red beans (full of some pork product that's not quite bacon) for vegetarian and all-around higher in antioxidant black beans. I had their Classic Margarita (on the rocks, not a slushy thing) and would gladly get it again.Great time on the patio a lovely busy Saturday night. (great service while we waited, vegetarian options, good margarita, great service at the table)
Great food! Very good service! The Fajitas are amazing! Can get a bit crowded on the weekends. Best Mexican food in the area.
I've been here with some co-workers for lunch, and had a great experience. Therefore, when a small group of us wanted to hang out outside (since it was so nice out) I suggested this place. Seating outside (yay!) and decent food. The chips are great- a little oily, but not too bad. Salsa is not one of my favorites, but definitely worth coming back for. It's got a smokey taste to it. They keep refiling your chips and salsa if you ask for it. We got some margaritas, and the concensus was: lime- good, the lime/sangria mix- too sweet, strawberry- sweet but good. The waiters were a little slow to say the least, but it was a nice day just to hang out outdoors, but if I was in a hurry I'd definitely be upset. We got 2 appetizers: veggie quesadillas and tamales. Both equally delicious, there was a ton of quesadillas- so definitely a meal or enough to share with up to 4 people.
Up north in Canada, we don't get too much good tex mex. I usually avoid chains, but since I've never heard of Uncle Julio's, it doesn't really count.  I went here with a work colleague on an overnight in Arlington, and was pleasantly surprised.  I had Herschel's platter which was jammed with a stuffed pepper, a tamale, and other tasty stuff.  I couldn't come close to eating it all, but I would have liked to.The drinks were nice too - in Toronto, a margarita is all juice, no tequila. Here it seems to be the opposite. Two drinks had me half in the bag.
I'd put this place in the same bucket as Chili's/On The Border. It's not what you would call "authentic", but it's tasty. The portion sizes and prices were fine, and the salsa that came out with the chips was nice and smoky, which I love. The service was fine and the food came out quickly.  Overall a good place to grab Americanized Mexican food.
Superb. Get the chili con queso for your chips. And don't skip the dessert empanadas. God I wish they had Mexican food this good in NYC.
Not even close, it's no Houston, TX Lupe Tortilla (thus the four - and not five - stars) but hey, this place keeps the chips full, has decent margaritas, good queso and excellent fajitas. Cactus Cantina has far superior enchiladas (although Rio Grande's are not bad!). Still, if you stick to the fajitas at Rio Grande, you will not be disappointed. Both the chicken and steak are equally good, so I usually get the "combo."   Finally, it's a great place for a fun group.
Hmmm.... struggled with 2 or 3 stars here, but I'll go with three because I really had no complaints and the waiter was a nice guy.Just your average Mexican chain joint, you're not going here to steep in the culture of authenticity. Chips are good, salsa is smokier than I like and not as hot as I'd like, but not bad. Guadalajara combo is a good portion of food, steak fajita was juicy and the shrimp is tasty. Wrapped in bacon and stuffed with cheese, how could it not be... and served with melted butter? Enough to give a Chicago Superfan another heart attack. (SNL reference. Damn I might be getting old).Prices are a little on the high side for what you're getting, but not outrageously so.
Love this place. I know it's a chain but the food and drinks are delicious and arrives quickly! Service is almost always great and when it's not great it's nothing major. The only drawback are the copious amounts of children, but that's my problem.
Excellent restaurant. We called ahead and, after showing up about 20 minutes later, were seated almost immediately. (They don't take reservations, but accept "call-ahead" wait list calls). The food and service were both excellent. The place was loud and packed (to be expected on a Friday night), leading me to believe that this is a popular restaurant known for good food. I think Mexican should generally be dirt cheap, but I've come to realize that that just isn't the case in the DC metro area. The prices here are comparable to other Mexican restaurants in the area (e.g. 3 chicken tacos--which were huge and included rice, beans, and salad--cost about $10.50). Beer prices were comparable to other Mexican places in the area as well....$4.50 for Corona and most other imports, $4 for Miller and most other domestics.There wasn't any apparent designated parking for the restaurant, but there was ample street parking on nearby residential (Ballston) side streets.
I finally went here recently after walking past it on a regular basis for over a year. My roommate came along, he gave it a good recommendation. This place didn't disappoint. Rio Grand Cafe has the same feel and style to it as Lauriol Plaza near Dupont Circle but just slightly more casual. Some of Rio Grande Cafe's combo platters were eerily similar to Lauriol Plaza. I ordered the Herschel Platter, which consisted of a chicken enchilada, a cheese chile relleno, a pork tamale and a soft beef taco. It was very good. The waiter was excellent. He brought us extra salsa and chips when he saw we were getting low in supply. Plus he didn't try to rush us to order. It wasn't too crowded but it was a Tuesday night and after 7. A fun place to go for some Tex-Mex while in the Ballston area.
Glad we read the reviews before hitting this place up...the fajitas rocked! The chips and salsa are tasty but don't fill up on those before ordering your fajitas. I had the combo beef and chicken and both meats were delicious. The server will ask if you'd like the veggies on top which is their way of asking if you'd like to pay $2 extra for some grilled tomatoes, onions and peppers with the meat. Kind of sneaky, I felt. When you're already paying $18 for the fajitas (pretty pricey in my book), I feel like/expect that the veggies should just be included. It's fairly noisy but family friendly and seemed good for larger groups.
I've been going here for years and it's pretty awesome. Definitely a fun atmosphere for a night out with friends. The chips and salsa they give you are top-notch. The food and drinks are both good..but not great. However, if you're up for a super-fun drink with extra punch order a Sauza Gold with Corona. Their regular margarita's are good too, though.Overall, I definitely recommend it. It can get a bit loud when it's busy, though, so don't expect an intimate meal.
I used to go here constantly when I lived in Ballston. I practically lived off of this food during grad school. The food is pretty good. I especially like the chicken taco platter served with a Tecate in a big frosted mug. The enchiladas are good here too. The complementary chips and salsa can't be beat and if you have to wait for a table the bartender is always willing to give you a basket of chips and salsa while you wait. The thing that sets this restaurant apart is the unbelievably quick and attentive service. I do enjoy the food, but the service is the real star at this location. The meal sometimes would arrive at the table two minutes after ordering and that was good because I would usually be starving after a long day. They are usually very efficient here. I have been to some other locations and the service has not been anywhere near as good. I wish their Illinois locations could take a page from the Arlington location and concentrate on providing better service because they do have a good product.
I go for the chips and salsa, I'll be honest. They're really the only reason I keep going back.Rio Grande used to be fantastic. It used to be somewhat reasonable in price... and I feel like now all it is is a racket. I used to always get fajitas (which, I'll give them, they're great here) but now they're ridiculously priced and I refuse to pay almost $20 for not-twenty-dollars-worth-of-food.The ambiance is nice, as they all are, and service is almost always good (at all the locations I've visited... Arlington, Fairfax, Reston). I got the Sonora Platter the other day at lunch. At $8.95 it's a great value, as you get a taco (beef or chicken), an enchilada (beef or chicken), and a tamale (beef or pork).Their enchiladas are ok, I do enjoy the sour cream sauce, though... and mixed with their hot (red) sauce, it's bomb. The taco was a taco. Nothing special whatsoever. And the tamale (I got the pork) was bland and dry and lame.Maybe I've been spoiled by the boyfriend's dad's (they're Mexican) home-cooking, but I'm just not a fan of the food here.The chips are awesome. The salsa is amazing. The queso is horribly good.That's about it.
Nice place, lots of space, just ok food.Part of the reason I get mexican is that I get tired the of normal flavors you find in day to day food. I was a little disappointed with Julio's, the food was surprisingly bland. I am pretty sure there were a number of ingredients in there, but all I tasted was some pepper.Other than that, like I said, the space is nice and the service was pretty good. Maybe it's because I had their breakfast menu, but either way I won't find myself back here again.
I will never go to another chain Mexican restaurant again. This place was overpriced and just sucked. I got the combination enchiladas (beef and chicken) and the chicken was all right, but the beef one was just gross. The only decent thing about this place was the guacamole and the salsa. If you ever have to go here, I recommend just sticking with the salsa and ordering the guacamole and then go somewhere afterwards for a real meal.
This is a generous review as far as I'm concerned. Perhaps I'm growing kinder in my old age. This place just feels cold and fake. You just wish for a relatively large Mexican place that isn't a damn chain restaurant. You don't get that here at all. Its a step above Chevy's... which, I don't know if I should even bother reviewing. Anyway, the food is meh... just that. The "famous" tortilla soup is nasty. Its basically just flavored water and soggy tortilla chips with poorly sized vegetables... they're just too big and its not worth your while.I like the largess of the menu, but I don't know if they should try for such lofty goals when they don't get much right... or anything that I've tried yet anyway. I had the shrimp ceviche once and it was just awful. It took forever to come out and it was so damn salty that I wanted to choke. The shrimp quesadilla was littered with bombs of old bay or something nasty. One bite... hmm, ok... next bite, KAPOW! Old Bay explosion! Way too much, its just stupidly unappetizing. I've wasted too much time already. Done.
For a chain Mexican restaurant, this place is really really good. By far one of the best Carne Asadas I have ever had. Happy hour specials aren't the best but the drinks aren't excessively expensive anyways. Costs a little more than say, Chili's, but sooo worth it!
I normally go to the Reston location, but my parents were visiting from out of town and we happen to be in Arlington, so we stopped here for brunch on a Sunday, which was amazing!My mom had mentioned something to the waiter that they had never been there and were excited to try something new, and at the end of our meal they brought out a free desert that was basically fried dough with a honey dipping sauce.... it was good though!I was very impressed with their customer service and appreciate that they made my parents first time there a memorable one!
When I first came here, I think their menu described how Rio Grande Cafe was started by a guy whose family runs some Mexican food restaurants in El Paso. I think this guy was exiled. Having come from Texas, I kept looking.
WARNING: Chips and Salsa may cause you to become an addict! I can't remember how many I ate which is really sad..lucky for me, I'm not counting these calories. Otherwise, I probably consumed my entire caloric intake for the day!!! I came here to celebrate my sister's birthday and to start off we had the guacamole was really good I have to say. I've tried Rosas and Guapos and this one is up there in terms of ratings. Again, if you must stay away from the chips, the guac is also the next best thing to stay away from. My sister and ordered the combination fajitas (chicken/steak) and it was great. From the homemade tortilla to the most tenderized steak, this is a must try entree. I don't recall what other people had and didn't care at the moment, so I can't really give you any other recommendations... So, chips/salsa/guac 5 stars...entree 5 stars...oh and service 5 stars!
Some of the best fajitas in D.C. Wait times can be a bit long because of its popularity, but they have a bar at the entrance to order your drink while you wait. Margaritas are good and not too expensive. Has all the rest of the standard tex-mex expereince, including the free chips and kitschy decorations. Better food than the Chevy's that is a few blocks away. I usually go to Chevy's for happy hour however, because their HH prices are great.
2.5 starsThis might be one of the most ridiculous restaurants I've ever eaten in. Kitsch, kitsch, kitsch. The only thing that would have made it unbearable would be if the servers were wearing sombreros. Thank God they weren't.My coworkers and I hit up Rio Grande for a birthday lunch. We'd called ahead and made a reservation, but apparently there was some confusion and our table wasn't ready, but we were accomodated. I'll just say it now: the only reason I would go back would be for the food, which wasn't that bad. Granted, I've had better (I'm sure we've all had better), but the chicken enchilada with red sauce was flavorful, and came with rice and a side of chopped tomatoes and shredded lettuce. Not sure what the point of "salad" was. Maybe I was supposed to put it on top of the enchilada. Who knows.So, food not bad. Service wasn't bad either. But the decor is just so damn cheesy!
I liked this place better when it was just the Rio Grande Cafe. The menu has changed since then and the selection feels somewhat more limited.It's still a good old standard for Mexican(ish) food in Ballston. The salsa never impressed me much but the chips are delicious. The food is in general good but it doesn't knock my socks off.The main reason I like the place is that they're the only spot in Arlington that I've found that makes ceviche (a south american raw fish dish). It's sadly only an appetizer, but tasty.
I've been to Rio Grande quite a number of times, especially since it's practically on the same block as my apt. Though since it is a minute or two away, I don't go *that* often... relatively. First off, their margaritas and the swirl (frozen marg and sangria swirled together) are really good. And they are on special during their happy hour. Unfortunately the HH specials only last till like 6 or 6:30, which is when most people are just getting off work. If I leave work early for some reason, it's definitely an option for a place to grab a drink.Next, their chips and salsa are quite addicting. I could eat at least a whole basket by myself, and oftentimes do! The rest of the food has been hit or miss. I think the tamales, the carne asada, the guac, the queso, the fresh tortillas, and some of the brunch options are really delicious. However the salads, the bacon wrapped shrimp, the veggie platter, the nachos, the enchilada and the tacos were all so-so, but lacked something (I don't know what).Overall, it's an okay place to grab dinner with friends, cause it's convienent (near the metro, in ballston, so could easily be the first spot for drinks in a night). But I hope there are better tex-mex options in the area that has better food for the same price, or cheaper. Guess I'm still searching for that.It is however much better than Chevys which is a couple streets over in the mall.
This has become one of our favorite stops in Arlington. We have never had a bad experience. Good food. Good service. Good atmosphere. Chips/salsa/queso - heavenly. My wife loves the flautas and for good reason. They're crunchy and delicious. I go with the Juanita's Platter which is always cooked perfectly. And the best part - great frozen drinks (definitely go for the swirl!).
I went here for dinner with a group and enjoyed it. I would probably give it 3.5 if I could. They keep the chips coming, and the yummy salsa. We split the nachos and they were nice and neat, if a bit too heavy on the beans. I liked the chicken soft tacos, and I liked that the chicken was shredded. The strawberry margaritas were large and yummy. :)
I was disappointed with the quality of food at this restaurant, particularly because I really enjoy the original Uncle Julio's restaurant in Dallas, where they have the exact same menu, but the food is significantly better. With my fond memories of the other Uncle Julio's, it hurts my soul to have to give this one such a low rating.I had a combination plate with pork tamales and the chicken enchiladas. The tamales were good, and I'd get them again if I came back. The chicken enchiladas were boring and bland, even though they're amazing at other locations. The sour cream sauce they put on the enchiladas is usually so delicious I want to bathe in a giant vat of it, but at this particular location, it was nothing special. The sides were forgettable.The sopapillas were fine, but not quite as fluffy and light as they're supposed to be.I had a pretty good margarita on the rocks, but then I made the mistake of ordering a frozen sangria. I usually love sangria, but this was, without a doubt, the most disgusting beverage I've ever consumed in my life. I took the first sip, and there was no mistaking it: "This tastes like the smell of a perm!" I proclaimed.Perhaps this requires some background information. While I've never gotten a perm myself, I spent a lot of time in the hair salon my parents owned when I was a small child in the 1980s, when perms were a regular occurrence. The chemicals used in this process have a horrible and very distinct smell. When I had the first taste of the frozen sangria at Uncle Julio's, I started experiencing mental flashbacks to my childhood, because it tasted exactly like the smell of a perm. When I complained about the frozen sangria, the waiter switched it out with a margarita at no extra cost, but I feel like that wasn't enough. It was so bad that I resent the fact that they served this swill to me in the first place and expected me to drink it. Ideally, I would like to travel back in time and not try the frozen sangria, and then we can call it even. Until that happens, I won't be back to this restaurant.
Some friends and I checked this place out last week because we were craving mexican and this place was packed on a random week night, so we figured it couldn't be that bad. My friends are easily impressed, but I thought the tacos were ridiculously bland and everything was ridiculously overpriced for the quality of the food. The only redeeming factor was the frozen sangria which was good, but overall this place was completely forgettable, and I would not go back.
Well, I have to admit that as far as chains go, this is definitely a winner. They have really good tacos, and decent margarita's. Not as good as some others though, (Cactus Cantina). The chicken nachos are really good too. The service is consistent and the food comes out really fast. It's a great place to take the family or go with a group after work. The wait can be a real deterrent, but the good news is that they have a call ahead number: (703) 266-7760. Use it to see how long the wait is and get placed in line before you even arrive. Overall pretty good. My wife and I eat here about once a month.
My favorite Tex-Mex place. I can't say much more than just YUM! Fajitas are my faves, chips are awesome, guacamole is great, drinks are plentiful and the staff is nice. Highly recommended, you won't be disappointed.
I love this place. The fajita style chicken quesadillas are excellent and the fajitas are amazing. The chips are made fresh and are addictive. The cajet desert is great to share with friends.
As a self-proclaimed Tex-Mex connoisseur I'd say that this one is your average fair... the food was good. Typical for a Tex-Mex place.The drinks the group I was with ordered weren't up to par though... The frozen sangria... let's just say if a permanent (like for your hair to make it curly - do they even do those anymore?) could taste - it would taste like this. It was horrible. The margaritas were a disappointment as well, so in the end I stuck to strait tequila (and a ride home :o) ). If you just want to enjoy food and don't care about the drinks, this place should do it for you.
Best Steak Fajitas in the area... This place is actually from Texas, I've eaten down there in Dallas... It's delicious... But anyway, the location in Ballston (Arlington) is great! Steak Fajitas = medium rare perfection with delicious dark marinade... The place can get busy at night, and especially on weekends, so be prepared for a 30-60 minute wait... Validated parking in the building itself is a nice touch...
I don't understand the excitement surrounding Uncle Julio's Rio Grande. I recognize that it has a large outdoor seating area, which is great for sipping their watered down margaritas during the summer. It serves a large variety of Mexican food. But - the food is sub-par at best. The enchiladas are nothing but cheese bombs with bland sauce on them. The fajitas are OK but often overcooked. The carne asada is also frequently overcooked. It is convenient to the Ballston Metro, but just like most of Ballston, is yet another chain restaurant. Really, if you want good Mexican and are willing to chain restaurant it up, you've really got to choose Chevy's in Pentagon City over this. Or better yet, head over to Guajillo or Oyamel. If you just want to eat slop covered in low grade "cheddar" while sipping watery margaritas surrounded by mediocre people, then head over to Uncle Julio's.
I was very pleasantly surprised by this chain restaurant. I've only eaten the fajitas (chicken and beef) during lunchtime, but everything is really fresh. The beef, chicken, tortillas, guacamole... everything. The salsa is delicious, too.
WOW. It's been a while since we ate here - back when we were still living in Ballston - but not so long that I don't remember the last time we gave it another "college try." This is definitely NOT the place to go to, if you want to spend at least part of the time "conversatin'". It's really WAAAY too noisy for that. I can remember back in the early days when it was a lot quieter, and the perfect place to come and eat for singles, couples, Tex-Mex lovers or just casual foodies in general. Now it's a huge 'turista' feed-bag, choked with more high chairs and strollers than you'd see at any faux-restaurant at Disneyland/World. NOT that there's anything wrong with that, as Mr. Jerry would say...Sadly, as the decibel levels have risen, the quality of the food has 'mos def' fallen. Best item on the menu (at least for me) is still the chicken fajitas, and you get more than your money's worth. They'll also keep bringing you fresh, hot tortillas until the cows come home. Which brings me to the one staple of Uncle Julio's that hasn't changed. Because they do make all their chip and tortilla products right on the premises, their taste is second-to-none. Although it would certainly earn you a dirty look from the wait staff, you could make dinner just out of the chips and salsa and margaritas and not have anything else!Speaking of which - the straight-up margaritas are sublime, but watch out for the fancy 'swirl' ones, which suspiciously resemble tequila-flavored Slurpees. (Now THERE'S something maybe 7-11 should try!)All-in-all, not a bad place to go when you're in "cave dweller" mode. ("Me HUNGRY. Me no talk now. Me EAT.") But there are places to get better (and QUIETER) Tex-Mex. Oh, yeah and one more thing: come early on the weekends. They DON'T take reservations during that time, and if you move too slow, count on at least a 45-minute wait. OUTSIDE. Which is not all that bad on a warm evening in July, but January? Uh-uhnh.
The steak fajitas are delicious. Leave everything else alone.
I like the chips, salsa, fajitas, and margaritas here, and I like that I can get both in like 10 minutes (if that). The service is efficient and friendly, and the food is consistent, if a little overpriced. Tip: If you're feeling healthy, you can order the chicken fajitas no skin/no butter, and the taste is still just as good - they must have a killer marinade. My one weird complaint? I wish they served grilled peppers with the fajitas (although they probably would if I asked). Oh, and it's just silly to have to pay extra for sour cream.
I have been a big fan of Rio Grande Cafe since its debut in Northern Virginia. What is great is that the taste has been so consistently good for all these years even at other new locations such as in Reston, Fairfax, Bethesda and Gaithersburg. They have the best home made chips and salsa, fajitas al carbon, and the flan. If you eat here, you do not ever want to eat at any other Tex-Mex restaurant any more! Seriously!
Okay - Uncle Julio's can SO be beat. It is such a mediocre, unhappy, and uninspired run of the mill restaurant.Try about - any - other Mexican restaurant in DC and the food will be better.The food here is sub-par, the service is slow, and the place is tacky. Their beer selection sucks, unless you're a huge Miller Lite fan. If you want good, filling, Mexican-American food, go to Cactus Cantina, Rosa Mexicana, or Loriol Plaza in DC.Skip this place!
The salsa is fresh. The chips are delicious. I love, love, love the fajitas. Nicely grilled. Good tortillas. Yum.
Mexican in DC is not easy to do.After living in SoCal for 5 years and being spoiled with good mexican places coming here is a culture shock. Even back home in NY there are quality mexican places that know how to make a yummy fajita and a strong margarita.DC...black hole.The good. The margaritas are strong, but they actually don't taste that good. And more to the point they are very expensive. Certainly not the best margarita in town. Gaujillo (sp?) is preferred in this regard if you are looking for some margaritas in arlington.The Bad: Fajitas just didn't have that much flavor and the onions were undercooked. Very expensive for fajitas and you have to pay extra for sour cream and cheese? Seriously? I feel like I'm on a US Air Flight with all the extras i need to pay for.Thumbs down.
The swirled margaritas are pretty good along with the fajitas. I like the atmosphere, however it can be kind of loud at busy times. Lately, the food has been more hit and miss than it used to, a few years ago. I do like the tortilla maker.
Wow. This place is loud!The salsa and the chips passed by test though. The food was hot, and the service was good. Made a great lunch place--I didn't try the margaritas cause I am not exactly a 5' oclock somewhere type of girl. Next time I am here for dinner/happy hour will be sure to dabble.
Mediocrity galore. Decent (though overpriced) drinks, tasty but runny queso, bland food, pretty good (if a tad slow) service. The significant other and I were left stuffed and near-comatose after the greasefest that is Rio Grande's fajitas and enchiladas, yet felt oddly unsatisfied. Not awful, but zero interest in returning.
Free chips and salsa (salsa that's not quite as good as Lauriol, but still pretty good!), lots of seating (but it can get crowded at peak times), and decent food (not sure how great tex-mex can acutally get).Like the swirl margaritas (frozen margarita/sangria) and they go down so smoothly...They do allow for substitutions, which is nice to get a plateful of food that is actually what you want.Had the Juanita's platter - 2 enchiladas, 1 crispy taco and 1 tamale. Tons of food for a reasonable price for dinner. I only wish they gave a soft taco instead - the taco shell was super hard it just shattered and disrupted the meal. My favorite part was the tamale actually - PORK TAMALE! Delicious. The enchiladas were good standard fare. Little too cheesy for me, but still yummy. And of course I love rice.The beer is ground beef, so I avoided that - if they had the beef tips, I'd have been all over that, but don't like my cows ground in my tacos.Been there a few times and would go back. Outdoor seating is a premium on a nice day but it's not so bad to sit inside and catch the breeze with a nice cold margarita in your hand too.
I should probably preface this review by saying that I'm not someone who complains about restaurants very often... I am very easy to please and rarely have negative dining experiences. I was truly disappointed with my experience at Rio Grande. I went to this restaurant because I recently moved to the area and thought the restaurant was a chain of Rio Grande in Fairfax, which I used to enjoy.The meal was fine. Again, I can't complain about the food... how can you really go wrong with Mexican?  My friend and I ordered drinks, and his margarita was probably one of the smallest I've seen. I ordered enchiladas, and the waitress asked me if I wanted green or red sauce. I chose red, since she said it was less spicy. She asked if I wanted sour cream on the side, and I didn't really want it but I said sure. My friend ordered green sauce on his enchiladas. I'd have to say the service was good, although it was very annoying to be asked every 5 minutes whether we were doing ok.The disappointment happened when we received the check. My friend's margarita was $10! I was charged an extra $1.75 for the sour cream and $.75 extra for the red sauce!! Now, I realize this isn't a large amount of money, but I was upset by the principle. When I asked about the charge for the sauce, she explained that the enchiladas come with a cream sauce and the red is extra. I would have been fine with the standard sauce! Why did she even give me the option?I didn't see any reason to complain, since nothing was seriously wrong with the food. I'm not saying not to go to this restaurant - the atmosphere is very good, but I just wanted other people to be aware of all the extra charges before going.
Rio Grande has decent food. They give you free chips and salsa which is really good. The frozen margaritas are a bit expensive. It's a good place if you want to sit outside and enjoy the nice weather while having dinner.
Okay, so I'm a Texan too. But Dallas Tex-Mex is more like American-Mex but a little better, and this chain is straight out of Dallas. If you look at a map and see how big Texas is, look at how Dallas is like the furthest city from the border. It makes sense. I've been here twice, and each time one of us got queasy-sick. I only went here when I was craving Tex-Mex and had no other choice.Plus once I asked for a "Modelo Especial" from the waitress. She had no idea what that was. When we then asked, ok, what kind of beers do you have, she rattled off a list that included "Especial". We stopped her and asked what the "Especial" was. She said, "Oh, it's a Mexican beer." *schmack*P.S. They used to offer a cheap cut of meat for fajitas in addition to the whatever-top-of-the-line-steak they offer. It's much tastier because they marinate it the traditional Texas border way (it made me say "yum", while the higher end stuff made me say nada). But the last time I had to go there, I couldn't find mention of this anywhere on the menu anymore. Inquire about it if you're in the mood for beef fajitas. If they have it, they'll try to talk it down, but don't listen to them. You know, it might be their carne asada, but sliced up and grilled for fajitas...
I know I have a peculiar set of tastes for Border food, so take this as you will. That said the best I have ever found (and I've been to their locations in Texas, Chicago and now out here in Virginia) is Uncle Julio's. It simply cannot be beat. I'm not sure how it is always both fresh and consistent. I heartily recommend the steak fajitas and the sopapillas (for those without gluten allergies) and vanilla ice cream for dessert. As an aside, the staff at this location seems to be particularly on top of their game. The waiter and manager were both charismatic and fun and welcomed us with enthusiasm, upon hearing that we'd come in search of them after having experienced Uncle Julio's elsewhere. They maintain an attentive atmosphere and based on the size of the lunch crowd, I'd say people take notice. I crave their food and I'm fervently looking forward to my next visit.
This is one place that everyone in my office can agree on for lunch....we even drive across the river to go there!It's TexMex all the way - but more authentic than most of the joints in the DC area that tend to be more Latin American. The winners here are the fajitas (particularly the shrimp - they don't skimp), the Carne Asada and the Guadalajara (a dish with steak and shrimp). And if you still have room, the sopapillas are awesome.The atmosphere is fun, if a little on the chain restauranty side - but can get pretty loud during the lunch rush. They have nice outdoor seating when the weather is nice. Service is always good. We've been treated to free desert on at least one occasion, and a waiter accidentally spilled a soda on a coworker one time and they immediately gave him a certificate for free dry cleaning.Also, I love a place that has a garage and full validation. Don't mess with the meter parking near by.
Rio Grande features a great mix of Tex-Mex and Interior Mex (D.F.) dishes. Speaking as a native Texan, I can say this is the best Mexican food I've had north of Dallas, including a whole bunch of places, best left unnamed, that offer "authentic" yet amazingly wimpy D.F.-type chow.I brought some Mexican friends here a while back, expecting them to not be very impressed. One guy poked around with the frijoles rancheros they serve on the side, took a bite, and his eyes went wide. "Damn! These taste just like my grandmother's!"Fajitas and carne asada, outstanding. Cabrito maybe the best I've had in or out of Texas. Great beer selection. LOUD later in the evenings.Yeah, there's more than one, so I guess it's part of a chain. Big whoop, it's still good.
A pretty average tex mex place. The chips and salsa are really good, and the fajita chicken is really good too (chicken fajitas, or I think they have a fajita chicken burrito too). The other food I've had though is just OK. But if you're in the area and want Tex Mex this is a pretty good place to go. The prices seem too high for the type of food though. You don't usually expect to spend a lot on Tex Mex.
I have a group of friends that love to get together and go hangout here. Besides starting out with the chips and salsa we have this ritual of ordering guacamole, queso with chorizo, mexican butter, and soft flour tortillas. I've seen my friends create all sorts of crazy appetizers with this mix. Yummy. The house margaritas are always a favorite and the specials are pretty decent. The service is usually on point.
I'm not a huge fan of tex mex but I came here for a friend's birthday party tonight. I don't think they take reservations and we had a group of 12. People started showing up at 7:30 and a majority of the group was there by 8 and we weren't seated until 8:40. The place had plenty of tables open and the hostess kept making excuses then suggested we split the group into two tables. We finally talked to the manager who was able to accomodate our group. We were all starving by then.Service was sufficient and the manager knew that several of us were peeved. They have good chips and salsa. I had ordered the tortilla soup to start but I got that after I finished my entree. The soup was good - it had big chunks of veggies (much of which I left in the bowl) and I ate all the chicken, broth and tortilla chips. I had the beef Flauta dinner which is 3 deep fried tacos (they're rolled up and have mainly just beef in it with a little bit of pepper and onion) with guacamole, sour cream and a side of rice. It was all edible but nothing wowed me.The manager brought us dessert on the house. The birthday girl got two large ice cream sundae-type dishes with candles in them and we sang Feliz Cumpleanos to her which was nice. They also brough two huge dishes with these mini fried dough squares with powdered sugar that you can dip in honey. That was good and a nice gesture to make up for the horrible time we had getting seated.The atmosphere is fun - loud music, lots of colors. There's a slim to no chance that I'll ever be back.
This is my most-frequented restaurant and I love it. It's also a "gold mine" -- they get a steady lunch crowd, a big happy hour crowd (huge on Friday and Saturday) and a packed house for every dinner service, including many large tables and plenty of kids. It is super noisey when the dining room is full (brick walls and concrete floors for those harsh, echoey acoustics). They even do a brisk weekend brunch business (special menu with breakfast burritos, etc.). So, if you can, the time to go is off-peak (between 2 and 5). You'll have the place almost to yourself, better service, and a level of relaxation you can't get when it's rocking.The fajitas have been reviewed substantially already, but for my money they pale in comparison to the costillas (falling-off-the-bone pork ribs). They are served with a nice chipotle barbeque sauce, but are so perfectly glazed and smokey that they don't really need it. There's a platter that has a serving of both costillas and fajitas (with grilled onions and jalapenos, warm soft tortillas, pico de gallo and guacamole, and rice and their terrific beans) which is enough for two to share if you're starting with, say, an order of their consistently great pork tamales. The tamales are rich and very authentic and homemade tasting, and the accompanying chile colorado sauce (beef chile screaming with cumin) is a marvel. You can even get this sauce a la carte (not on the menu, but it's like $1.50 and well worth it).The other things I'd recommend are their cheese and onion enchiladas (topped with a beef-chile sauce), tortilla soup (nice grill-marked chicken and crisp vegetables in a really good broth, and caldillo (beef stew with poblano chiles...I think it's the Tuesday soup of the day).Tip: for a truly sublime margarita, order one on the rocks with El Tesoro Platinum and Cointreau. Skip their generic ones. My girlfriend likes their sangria on the rocks.Get a table outside if the weather's nice.
For me, this place is the ultimate in convenience, as it's literally across the street from where I live. Regardless of its location, this place still has great food. The chicken Fajitas here are the best I've ever had. I think there's a special on them on Wednesdays, if I remember correctly. Get them then, as the food here is a bit pricey for Mexican, but you get what you pay for: higher quality for a higher price.They primarily serve delicious chipotle salsa, but I think you can get regular salsa if you ask.Their margaritas are good, which I usually get every time I go. They are $7.50.My only qualm with the place is that there's always a wait, sometimes as long as 45 minutes during peak hour, but I guess that's a testament to the quality.
I live across the street from this place, basically, and had occasionally heard Mexican music blaring from inside. I wasn't particularly inspired to go (why bother when Flat Top and their delicious roti was virtually next door?), but a boyfriend said it was good and was in the mood for fajitas.When we walked in around 2 pm on a weekday, the place was virtually empty. We were seated at a table far away from the door, thus far away from the summer stickiness outside. The tortilla machine was in the middle of the dining room, but it wasn't being used. A basket of chips and salsa was delivered to the table. I'm not terribly picky about chips and salsa, so I'll eat just about anything resembling them. The chips were warm and the salsa was okay--but my homemade stuff is superior. :o) The boyfriend said we should get the fajitas, which you can order by the pound for something like $20 (ridiculous, anyone?). He said a pound would be fine for both of us, so he ordered a combo of chicken and steak. The waiter asked if we wanted cheese and sour cream with those, and the boyfriend said yes.15-20 minutes later, the fajitas arrived. A short stack of flour tortillas was provided. Two small plates with cheese and sour cream came out with the meat. The sizzling meat was moist and hot, and when wrapped up in a tortilla with all the accompaniments, it made for a nice little package. It was nothing exceptional, but I didn't have to cook it--and the boyfriend was putting it on the expense account--so it had that going for it.We didn't drink that afternoon, but I think I would have enjoyed myself more had we both had a margarita or two. A little liquor makes a mediocre meal seem a little less...average.The service was spotty. Our waiter disappeared for long periods of time, leaving both the tortilla warmer and our glasses empty. We saw the waiter schmoozing w/some other folks from the wait staff. We would have preferred significantly more attention. Once we got his attention, we asked for the check.The check arrived a ridiculous amount of time later (say, 15 min.?). We noticed we had been charged extra for the sour cream and cheese the waiter had so sneakily offered us. I didn't particularly appreciate that--but again, remember who was paying for the meal!We paid the bill, wrapped up some leftovers (meat, a couple tortillas, guac, etc.), and made our way out. I have not since been back to Rio Grande, nor do I expect to go back. For something like $20/lb., I'd rather buy some really nice cheese and eat it in the comfort of my own home.
Came here to celebrate a friend's graduation from Gallaudet U. Interesting place but was surprised how expensive this Mexican restaurant could be. My partner paid $55 bucks for the 2 of us.The fajitas were expensive...almost $20 per person. My partner had the chicken fajita. I had the carne guisada fajita. I dunno about my partner's but mine was delicious! Of course, I was fighting from getting my eyes watery. The steam from the pepper on the fajita were stinging my eyes. But it smelled so good! The rice was pretty good.The chips and salsa weren't bad at all. The chips were good. The salsa wasn't the best but it was one of the top that I've had in the DC area.I wasn't impressed with my strawberry margarita. I usually have the regular/top shelf margarita. But, I thought I'd have something different. I had a deep 'rita and I didn't even get a slight buzz. How disappointing!My friends had the sopapillas for dessert. One warning. Share an order of the sopapillas. Everyone, including me, thought that this dessert would contain 2 or 3 big sopapillas. However, they were actually the mini kind and had about 20 to 25 on a plate. Service wasn't all that fabulous. First of all, my friend, who graduated, had put in a reservation. However, when we got there, there was no reservation and told us that we had to wait 35 minutes. Uh, no! One of her relatives called for a manager and we were able to get our tables within minutes.Anyways, I wouldn't mind coming back for a second try. They better make a fabulous margarita for me next time.  Oh...if you park underground, Rio Grande will validate your parking ticket. That doesn't mean a free parking...just a reduced fare.
Great for Kids. Now I dont claim to be an expert on children, but recently went out with a friend with 2 kids, and they liked watching the tortilla machine do its thing (ooh.. fire and machinery). This allowed us to have some welcome adult conversation.I certainly enjoyed the margarita and chips. Also they sell fajitas by the pound which is definitely the way to go if you are out with some friends.Convenient to the metro, service was good.
A pricy, chainy feeling Mexican restaurant, about on par with Chevy's, though less of a chain. Their patio is great on a nice day, if you can get a seat. The bar area can get extremely packed and loud at night. Among their appetizers, I like the queso flameado, though the version with chroizo had less chorizo than salads have bacon bits. The fresh tortillas hot off the grill are always great. Go hungry because the portions are generous.
Awesome margaritas and fresh chips and salsa. Great place for a happy hour during the week. The entrees are alright, I like the enchiladas with the sour cream sauce. Prices are a little steep and it gets crowded, so I recommend it for a place for drinks early on in the night.
