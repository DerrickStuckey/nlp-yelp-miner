Hard to decide which dish was the best.  It's a good test and bodes well when roasted cauliflower can be elevated to a memorable dish - sultanas, almonds, feta, and a few thinly shaved peppers. The crispy eggplant with lemon pith and spicy honey is a delight. Zucchini fritters and dolmades rounded out the flavors. Nicely appointed setting, open kitchen, sound and music level are good. Nice by the glass wine list. The waitstaff worked at a team. Seems to be a well thought out and well managed restaurant. Well designed menu with many dishes that are appealing Can't wait to return and try the rest of the menu
Mike Isabella's new restaurant did not disappoint. Nice selection of unusual tapas style dinner plates and very nice decor. Was seated in the loft overlooking the chef's table watching George and Mike do their thing. The flatbread was insanely delish, as was the swordfish kebabs, the charred octopus and the whole bronzino!
Amazing food and service. Best things ordered - lamb, swordfish and the crispy eggplant (!!!!!!!!). Trio of spreads are great - avoid the "normal " hummus. Worst thing are the fried Brussels sprouts. Greasy and soggy.
The lamb shoulder was excellent, but unfortunately the service was not. Our party of 8 had to wait 45 minutes past our reservation time to be seated. This wouldn't have been so bad if the bar was laid out in a way that you weren't constantly in someone's way while standing there. Once seated, our waiter seemed quite flustered and rushed and it took a while to get our orders taken correctly. Our group ordered a couple of dips (delicious), the shellfish tower (which I was told was excellent but I'm allergic), the lamb shoulder (which was amazing), and a couple small plates (good but nothing exceptional). However it was what happened at the end of the meal that really made the meal memorable (in a bad way). My parents had notified the waiter that we were celebrating the birthday of my soon to be brother-in-law. The waiter brings out a scoop of sorbet with a candle in it, we sing happy birthday, birthday boy blows out the candle, then the waiter takes the sorbet AWAY from the birthday boy, plops it down in front of my dad and says, "I'm glad someone at the table ordered sorbet so I was able to bring out a candle!" I understand if the restaurant doesn't provide complimentary desserts for birthday celebrations, but I have never seen a waiter give someone a birthday dessert, take it away after it's been blown on, and then give it to someone else. It created a really awkward situation.
Perfect place to have tapas with friends. Atmosphere is great. Both bar areas are great. Overall great experience. Portions are typical tapas size. Highly recommend making reservations.
I've been anxiously waiting for this restaurant to open up. Even after it opened there were OpenTable snafus preventing an easy reservation. Thank God for the snow storm or we would have never gotten in on Saturday night! The drink I ordered was goodWe started with the favoslata spread (yellow lentil base) and warm bread and it was excellent. It will be hard to come back and not order this again. I think one spread is a better deal than the variety of three spreads judging by the size if it.Next we had garden mezza. I had the Caesar which contained peppers, was spicy hot, and came with no warning. I was disappointed and could not finish it. It was removed from the bill. My friend had the tikka salad that only had three walnuts. Skip the salads folks! Then we split he octopus; it was ok. A little salty. Texture ok.The shrimp mezza was to die for . Wow. Get this dish. Come here for this dish! It is yummy!! It stole the show. We ended with the sundae which was ok.
Tried this pace on a Saturday evening. The service was friendly and attentive - our water glasses were always full and we never felt pressured to order more. We tried the zucchini patties, the crispy eggplant, the cumin chicken, and the spicy salmon. I found it unusual that the veggies all came first followed by the proteins. Everything was bursting with flavor and texture, but unfortunately was also very salty. The salmon was undercooked. However, the cumin chicken was absolutely mind blowing. We had baklava for dessert. Nothing was too heavy, so overall we enjoyed the experience. We would come back again.
We usually go to their restaurant in DC. I must say that the food is better but the service is lacking. We saw a hair in our pita bread and the bartender never apologized just took it away. She showed the plate to a guy named Kent and he looked at us as if we placed the hair in there. Eventually they brought us another one but we felt like leaving at that point. Against our better judgment we decided to stay. The food was pretty good but the service was awful and the drinks weren't that great.. Not sure we'll be back to this spot or the place in DC. Too many places to settle..
Awesome dinner here last night. We had a party of 8 so we ordered a ton of mezzes and loved pretty much every item we ordered. The highlights for me were the octopus, the swordfish kabobs, brussels sprouts, and saganaki. The trio of dips was also a crowd pleaser along with the freshly made flat bread! We ordered the eggplant dish as suggested by WaPo but I personally wasn't a big fan of it - others at the table were impressed, however. The restaurant is also beautiful and the waitress did a great job handling our group.
My rating needs to carry the caveat that this place is still new and clearly has the standard new restaurant 'kinks' to work out....case in point: inconsistent service. I've been here twice. First time at the counter overlooking the kitchen and it took 25 minutes for any food to arrive. Second time, I sat at the bar and ordered an appetizer spread, which came within 1 minute, then I ordered two mezzes-be vegetable and one chicken. The veggies came almost immediately (which begs the question: had they been cooked earlier in the day and been sitting? Kind of greasy so I'm thinking 'yes'). It's now been 20 more minutes and no chicken. The bartender says this is normal. Maybe I'm not used to traditional Greek presentation(?). Food quality is good, albeit a little overpriced, and wine pours are not generous..3 oz max.Update: I just paid $80 for a cocktail, 6 oz of wine, a flat bread and two 'small plates'. Way overpriced.
Great, as expected. Inside is pleasant and spacious. There is a TON of seating between tables, the bar, and the counter with chairs that runs alongside the kitchen.We got the seafood platter, lamb, mushrooms and hummus. I don't know about the $75 price tag on the seafood platter, but the food was great and fresh (you get oysters, lobster, shrimp, tuna tartar, squid and mussels). Mushrooms and hummus were great and the lamb was one of the best things I've eaten recently.Service was great and attentive.The only thing I would recommend people stay far, far away from is their in-house-made hot sauce. First, it's carbonated. Yeah, I don't get it either. I shook the bottle, as I always do with hot sauce, and it started immediately frothing over right onto my plate. I love hot sauce so that wasn't a big deal until I tasted it. I can only describe the experience as weird and terrible. The taste was of chemicals and the spiciness was non-existent; certainly NOT for people who actually enjoy hot sauce.
I had high hopes for Kapnos, and I still do. I'm aware that it has only been open for a few weeks, but expected more from a Mike Isabella. First off, it seemed to be cold in the entire restaurant. It couldn't have been more than 65 and the fans seemed to hit us wherever we went-- I kept my vest on during my meal. Then it took about ten minutes for our server to even greet us, much less even take our drink order. Major props to the attentive staff who refilled our water... I wish my tip could have gone to them! My waiter (who I won't name, even though I really want to) paid barely any attention to us. It was another 15 minutes before he checked back to take our orders, maybe 15 for another check in and then he disappeared for about 20 minutes after that. I even tried to flag down a manager but I think they were so busy, he missed my hand waving in front of him as he breezed past me. Finally, I asked another manager for my check. Ten minutes later, my server came back to run the credit card... when he returned, he didn't even thank us for coming in! As someone who used to work in hospitality, I was incredibly disappointed by my experience. I was so excited for Kapnos to come to Arlington but couldn't believe the treatment we received, especially for the first few weeks! I joined Yelp specifically to write this review, and certainly hope that Kapnos can turn some things around in the next few months to back Mike Isabella's good name.
If you're a true Top Chef fan like me, you follow Top Chefs' restaurant scene. It's been great having one of my favorites, Mike Isabella, grow his restaurant empire here in DC. Now that I live in Arlington, I'm even happier that he is extending his reach here. Long story short, I've been anxiously awaiting for Kapnos Taverna to open and knew it would be the perfect place to dine during a visit from my dad.We were seated promptly for a reservation at 7:15 by a table relatively close where you could feel the cold the wind that was funneling in. Thank goodness for my dad because he was courageous enough to go up and ask if we could potentially be moved. He had spotted an open table a little ways down and suggested it as a solution. I was really pleased given how busy it was and reservations being tight, that they were so willing to compromise. Nestled into our new table, dad took care of the (real) first order of business - ordering some wine. We started with the Talbott, "Kali Hart," Chardonnay, which has a nice balance of richness and energy; perfect for drinking with various Greek dishes. Our game plan was to order a dish from each category (spreads to meat) but order three first and the rest once we were having the first set. We wanted to space things out and enjoy the moment, and our waiter easily obliged. To start, we ordered the "melitzanosalata" (smoky eggplant, roasted peppers, walnuts) spread, roasted beets with orange coriander dressing, and "kolokithokeftedes" (zucchini patties). The melitzanosalata was incredibly sweet and smoky; I honestly could have scooped up the whole plate with the warm, crusty flat bread served on the side. But as I'm a nice polite girl, or daughter in this case, I shared. Each ingredient of the spread worked in harmony with the others. Beets and oranges are a known delicious duo and the only thing roasted beets need is a light vinaigrette to be absolutely perfect. Including coriander in the mix was a welcomed addition; it added a warm, nutty, and spicy note to the dish. The zucchini patties had such pleasing contrasts; the crispy warm fritter with a cool spread of yogurt sauce.For our next round, we ordered the roasted crimini mushrooms and the charred octopus. We told our waiter that we were thinking about ordering the lamb ("meat" category) but since we were pretty full at that point, we decided not to. However it later ended up on our table. I've had grilled octopus before at other restaurants in the area and this blew those out of the water! No pun intended. If you've been eager to try octopus here is where to do it; tender rather than tough and seasoned just right. The mushrooms had a wonderful depth of flavor and meat-like in texture. The lamb was the only sub-par dish of the bunch as it was just slightly overcooked and pretty dry. We needed on a sweet note and ordered the lemon cake with thyme meringue and lebneh ice cream. The tartness of the lemon worked well with the tanginess of the lebneh (a Mediterranean, strained yogurt) and it had, overall, a delightfully airy texture. In my experience, there are a whole class of restaurants that offer small plates which in reality don't lend themselves to sharing and simply don't split well. However, Kapnos Taverna tastefully executed small plates; all of our dishes were perfectly portioned and made for easy sharing. Our whole experience here was wonderful and I can definitely see myself returning in the very near future. The atmosphere was so warm and lively: everyone around you is genuinely happy, the staff especially, and enjoying themselves. And one or two small missteps aside, the service was superb, friendly, and knowledgable. I'm looking forward to trying brunch here when the menu is finalized!
I had high hopes going into tonight to celebrate my brother and I'd birthday (we are twins) based on other yelp reviews; unfortunately, besides the good company, I left pretty disappointed. Hence my first yelp review. Food was solid and comparable to Zaytinya and Cava Mezze. Eggplant, Brussels sprouts and lamb were the standouts. The restaurant itself, however, was cold. Granted it was a cold and snowy night but the thermostat was set to 64 degrees and it was pretty drafty. They sat us right near the door, despite an open table reservation made way in advance and a note that we were celebrating two birthdays. Its pretty hard to eat when you want to be wearing your coat and your feet are cold. Then our service left a lot to be desired. We waited over 40 minutes for our drinks without any update (I couldn't even get our lackluster waiter to acknowledge us) and when they finally got there we got a flippant apology. It was not like the restaurant was all that crowded and wait staff was just standing around and the bar looked pretty stocked. Since or waiter disappeared for this whole time we couldn't even order more food besides our spread trio. It wouldn't have taken much to make me a happy birthday girl at this point, but when they only put one candle in the dessert despite the fact that it was two of our birthdays was the icing on the cake.
This restaurant is great! The food and the staff were excellent. I'll definitely be returning and will recommend to friends/family.
Great service and great food. The bread they use is great, especially with the lamb gyro.
This place is fantastic! My husband, my 3 year old son and I had lunch here and all raved (even my 3 year old) that it is our new favorite Arlington restaurant.We ordered the hummus, the falafel, the spit-roasted lamb, the meatballs and a lamb gyro. Everything was beautifully prepared and delicious, but the lamb and the fresh-baked flatbread were the stars of the meal. It was the perfect (and recommended, by our waiter) amount of food for three people. The only part of the meal that was so-so was the coffee (which was not bad, but not great).In addition to the exceptional food, the decor at Kapnos is lovely and the service is good.Love this place and can't wait to return!
Wow. Amazing from entry to exit. We were seated at the rail by the hot food station and had the pleasure of watching Chef Isabella expedite every dish to perfection. Our server was amazing! She was knowledgeable of her wines, had amazing suggestions and perfectly timed and paced our orders for a seamless evening. Ever dish delivered. Every single one. Not a detail was overlooked, even the perfect temperature of the hand sinks. I had an amazing evening with friends and an very happy that Mike Isabella had brought amazing food to Ballston in a beautiful space with a great staff. Keep up the great work!
Amazing experience!Food is amazing, service was super attentive, absolutely loved Kapnos Taverna.Only con is my whole dining party thought everything was too salty, but luckily everything was so delicious that we're prepared to let it go. The service is so attentive that your water glasses will be constantly full anyways.
This place was great. The atmosphere was lively, the food was superb, and the staff was super friendly. It's only been open for a couple of weeks, so even though we went on a Thursday night, it was packed and I was with a group of 7. I mean this place was insanely busy, there was standing room only near the two large bars, and this place isn't a small venue. It had all the makings of a disappointing evening when we were told they needed us to wait to free up the table we had reserved for 8pm. I was concerned that our food quality or attention from the waiters would suffer due to the number of people in the place. Neither could be farther from what we experienced. The waiters were all extremely friendly and took the time to ask us about any special meal requirements we may have. They not only accommodated everything we asked of them, but we're friendly about it.The food was amazing. Definitely heavy handed on the salt, and I wouldn't expect any less of authentic Greek cuisine. The hummus, feta dip & tzatziki were all very good. I personally had the short ribs and the brussel sprouts and wow... brussels were fried to perfection and so tasty - garnished with pomegranate seeds and lemon zest, just the right sweet and sour note to cut through the richness of the brussels. The short rib was extremely tender and served on top of a delicious slaw, such a nice balance to that dish. Someone at our table ordered the salmon and stated it was the best she's ever tasted. For desert, I had the salted caramel ice cream - again definitely didn't shy away from the salt - with apple tartlet. The tartlet left a little to be desired, but with the ice cream it was a great bite. Just a little too much tart and not as much apple as I had hoped.Mike Isabella even came out to greet us at our table! It was awesome to meet him. Just rounded out the whole experience. I would definitely recommend this place and will definitely be returning!
Given the Taverna has been a long-awaited arrival in this neighborhood, I really wanted to like it...but lunch today was inconsistent and disappointing. On its face, the menu is creative and appetizing; in execution, it's "a study in contrasts." After snagging seats at the chef's bar, my lunch partner and I ordered two mezze (falafel and spanokopita) and two open-face gyros (lamb and salmon). The spanokopita was one of the best I've ever had; the falafel was overcooked and greasy. The gyros? One good (salmon) ~ one not so much (lamb). On the bright side, the salmon flatbread was creative - the flatbread was warm, soft and a pleasant compliment to the salmon accented with dill. On the other hand, the lamb gyro was, sadly, absolutely forgettable. The lamb was overcooked, dried out and chewy - it tasted more like jerky than freshly roasted meat. To add insult to injury, the lamb gyro's flatbread was tough and absolutely unyielding to a knife and fork, making it almost impossible to eat. (We were told that gyros are served open faced at the Taverna because "it takes too long to serve it the traditional way"(?)). Lamb is one of the most traditional Greek foods - and it makes or breaks a Greek restaurant. I'm a foodie - and appreciate "interpretive cuisine" - but the next time I want a lamb gyro, I'm going to the Greek food truck at the Ballston metro. Service? We were greeted and seated promptly (it was early). After taking some time to study the menu, we ordered and the food arrived promptly - although backwards - gyros first, mezze second. Having worked tables myself, I found it a bit perplexing that no one stopped to see how we liked the food or whether we'd received what we'd ordered. In fact, we didn't see our server again until we asked for the check. The bussing staff, however, were prompt with beverage refills and clearing dishes. With two $4.00 iced teas, the total tab for lunch was close to $60.
1st time at Kapnos. Great food, horrible service. Was totally disappointed by how rude our waiter was, especially considering that this place opened so recently.
Randomly stopped in last night for dinner without a reservation and got a seat at the chef's counter. The menu had great variety, with lot of dishes on the heavier/more indulgent side. I think at one point we had an entire spread of dishes in front of us featuring variations of feta, flatbread and potatoes..but no one was mad. This place is Greek small plates, and everything consumed was flavorful and delicious. I left Kapnos feeling very full, and very giddy...but that might be because I got to meet chef Mike Isabella....swoon!
Only for Mike Isabella would I travel all the way to Ballston and as expected, he did not disappoint! I also need to give credit to Chef George as he was there serving up delicious dishes and sadly not competing on Top Chef anymore. We came for dinner early on Friday and it was PACKED, thankfully we had a reservation and were seated immediately. I will make a small note to say that we had possibly the world's most annoying waitress but she was attentive and provided great service, so I'll let her personality/voice slide. The interior is different from Mike Isabella's existing restaurants but it is gorgeous and has a really cool looking exposed second floor. There is something to look at from every angle whether you are seated by the bar the raw bar or by the exposed kitchen. We opted for cocktails that evening and started off with the hummus spread. It was served with warm pita and was absolutely delicious. How anyone eats hummus out of a package is beyond me! Fresh is the only way to go. For our second plate we ordered the swordfish kabob which was my personal favorite. The fish was perfect cooked and presented in bite sized portions. Great for sharing, but I probably ate most of it. Next we sampled the smoked oysters. Not being a fan of raw oysters but wanted to try out the raw bar, this was a great compromise. They were just cooked and seasoned enough for my taste but still oh so fresh and slurp-able.Following the oysters we had the chicken souvlaki. This was our least favorite but it was still a great dish. It is absolutely a classic greek dish but next time we'd probably opt for something a bit more out of the box. We finished our savory plates with the meatballs. These were my fiance's favorite. He likes to order meatballs wherever he goes and these were pretty close to the top of the list. Normally we skip dessert, but when in Rome. We opted for the Apple Tartlet which was SO GOOD. I would eat this every day if I could. This petite apple pie comes with salted Carmel ice cream which is a perfect pairing. My only suggestion would be that it come in a bowl because it slid around the plate a little too much and was hard to contain. Overall the food and service at Kapnos Taverna is fairly similar to the original Kapnos. Given the distance I will probably continue to visit Kapnos instead of trekking out Ballston but it is a great edition to the neighborhood. Hopefully more chefs will look to open in the neighborhood soon. Bravo, chefs!
Had a great experience at Kapnos on my first visit, loved the atmosphere, our server was very knowledgable and attentive and most of all the food was amazing!! Got to try a few things and my favorites by far were the pork souvlaki and crimini mushrooms. Can't wait to go back!!
So I've been to Kapnos in DC, and I think this is a valiant effort to bringing a related yet more casual and seafood-focused restaurant to VA. There are definitely a few items that are the same between the two restaurants (at least during lunch time when I went). The atmosphere here is pretty cool - there is PLENTY of bar space if you don't want to grab a table, and there are PLENTY of tables spread out over the two floors. At my table, near the cash register, you could smell the eucalyptus leaves as they were hanging from the ceiling. It smelled fantastic. Now on to the food...Two of us got three mezze and a soda. The soda, a blend of blackberry, lemon, and rosemary, was really good. The large sprig of rosemary was a nice touch, and even if you think the glass looks small for $5, it's actually pretty decent because the flavor is so strong. I don't think I could have handled a bigger glass of that same flavor (even though it is really good). I can't wait to try other ones! It was disappointing, however, that the hot chocolate wasn't on the menu, because I'm pretty sure I saw it online. For mezze, we got a cheese spread, crispy brussel sprouts (as they are amazing at Kapnos DC), and the crispy eggplant.A MEAL HERE IS BY NO MEANS HEALTHY OR LIGHT. My advice is to order less at the beginning of the meal.Everything we got was very decadent and heavy. The cheese spread was overly salty and made us quench water even a few hours after our meal ended. The brussel sprouts, while prepared the same way as at the DC location, was a smaller portion. They tasted the same, but it seemed more like brussel sprout leaves than healthier chunks. Lastly, the crispy eggplant was my favorite - the orange pith puree was delicious, but I wish there was more of it. The honey added a nice sweetness. I wish this dish wasn't fried.So, as you can see, the food was pretty middle of the road for me. What really made me give this place three stars was the service. Unfortunately, our waiter was a little absent and didn't really pay attention to us, even though the register and water pitchers were adjacent to our table (to which frequent trips were made). Our water glasses were never re-filled.Bottom line: the menu here is quite diverse that another trip will probably be worth it. If you are into Mediterranean food and enjoy sharing plates, this place could work for you.
Excellent food. Service and wine. From the Tarma salata to the apple tart I was wowed, I loved the mezze eggplant, octopus, lamb, all cooked to perfection. I can't wait to return
The food is amazing here! We tried flatbread with 3 dips, baked cheese, lamb & chicken souvlaki , fried eggplant & potatoes. Everything was perfect. Also the wine menu is extensive & the unique cocktails are unbelievable. Better make reservations!
Great location and excellent food. I love the size of the tapas, perfect for sharing. My favorite dish is the crispy eggplant...very unique flavors a Thai/Greek infusion. This is a great add for the restaurant scene in Ballston.
I was really excited to try Kapnos Taverna since it's brand new. Perhaps because of all the great reviews it's been getting, I hyped it way up in my mind and that's why I left just a little bit disappointed. I guess I was expecting to have my mind blown. I will say that I watch Top Chef and so was pleasantly surprised to see both Mike Isabella and George Pagonis cooking. I was seated at the chef's counter, which was way better than the regular tables or bar because you can see the line cooks at work at their various stations. Kapnos Taverna is about on par with Cava in Clarendon - solid greek tapas, some are great, others are just ok, nothing outright bad. The charred octopus was exceptionally cooked and the lamb tartare was not gamey at all and was mild and delicious! Brussel sprouts were also terrific with a hint of citrus! The short rib souvlaki, however, was surprisingly not tender at all with not a ton of flavor. It seemed like it was missing a sauce or something. Our waitress was nice and seemed knowledgeable about the menu considering the restaurant had just opened. I did notice that she never once asked us how the food was though, which I thought was a little odd especially for a new place.This is a welcome addition to Ballston though, and the ambiance is fun for a date night or small group. I'll be back to try some of the other menu items!
Yummy eggplant and chicken souvlaki. Don't sit by the draft of the front door. Also, food was a little salty but good all around!
I ate there the 3rd night it was open and they had everything together. Food was so yummie. We had a trio of hummus to start. All were delicious and the pita is homemade. Best I have ever tasted. We had the roasted chicken.... it was so flavorful and delicious. The wait staff were very knowledgeable and attentive; knew the menu really well and could navigate different options for a gluten free diner. Very thankful this is in Ballston.
Amazing dinner service tonight and flawless service for opening week! I would go back again this weekend because there are so many more dishes to try. The staff was warm and inviting and the ambience was perfection.  There's a great "hustle bustle" but it's not noisy.  Definitely try the smoked eggplant spread, stuffed grape leaves and chicken souvlaki. For small plates, the portion sizes are great if sharing with two people. We ordered four dishes and a fifth for dessert and we were stuffed. Thank you Mike Isabella for bringing your gifts to Ballston! Ps: The enormous bundles of hanging eucalyptus are amazing to see and smell.... What an incredible and thoughtful touch.
I have anxiously been awaiting the opening of this place and I AM so excited to have this delightful place across the street from home! When you first walk in, it's beautiful. I mean, the decor, the long bar, the hanging greens, and the minimalistic style - it screams fine dining. Even the bathroom was gorgeous! We were seated promptly for a reservation at 8 and our eyes were sparkling with excitement after perusing the menu. I absolutely LOVE mezze/small tapas places because you get to taste a little bit of everything and share plates, so I had high expectations for this place since I've come to favor Masa 14, Cava Mezze, and Zaytinya so much. I'll tell you, Kapnos does not disappoint! Boyfriend and I were more than pleased with the service, quality of food, and the menu. On to the food:My favorites were the charred octopus, the crispy eggplant, the cumin yogurt chicken souvlaki, the cheese saganaki, the marinated short ribs, and the spit roasted lamb. All of the items were so fresh and had my tastebuds kicking . The charred octopus wasn't chewy at all either. It was tender and soft and you can tell that it was fresh out of the kitchen. The crispy eggplant portion was also huge. There were about 4 big crispy pieces which was plenty for the 4 of us at our table. The spicy honey sauce with orange puree paired well too! It was an orange puree with some honey mixed with cayenne pepper and I'll tell you ever since last night, I've been mixing some cayenne with my honey and greek yogurt for a nice little kick. Kudos to the chef for that one! I've always loved the cheese saganaki at Cava Mezze and whilst the presentation wasn't a flaming skillet at the table at Kapnos, I must say I think I favor Kapnos' saganaki a tad bit more than Cava's. It had a lemon honey taste to it - really subtle, that gave it a nice little oomph of flavor, compared to Cava's. Don't get me wrong, I love me my cheese and the presentation at Cava Mezze, but that little extra touch of flavor went a long way at Kapnos. Another nice touch! Our server told us that they're currently working on the brunch menu. For being a brand new opening and I believe just starting dinner service - I give this place kudos for a flawless first dining experience there with them. You always expect a little screw up here and there, but our server was attentive and knowledgeable about the menu and well versed. I'm impressed. Dinner was a success and I'm excited to come back and try their lunch and brunch menus!
Mike Isabella comes to NoVa! Went to Kapnos Taverna on opening night and was not disappointed. The space is attractive and service was spot on. The menu featured a nice variety of meze, all well prepared. Traditional spreads, great house made pita, souvlaki of various types, salads and even Greek style raw bar were all beautifully prepared. Both Chefs Mike Isabella and George Pagonis were cooking on opening night! Two Top Chefs at the counter.....way cool! Wine list is well chosen and fairly priced. The cocktails look interesting.....next time. All in all, a hit and a welcome addition to the Ballston restaurant scene.
My first review on Yelp goes to Kapnos Taverna!I work in Ballston and this is one of the few nice restaurants we have in the area. I remember seeing this place under construction for a long time. I was more than thrilled when it finally opened and ecstatic when I tried this place.We ordered the flatbread tyrokafteri spread, king salmon, charred octopus, and Half Spit-Roasted Chicken. Everything is flavorful; their chicken was tender and juicy.Great food and great ambiance. For any fans of Top Chef, we were lucky enough to get a picture with Mike Isabella.
Visited this place last night and was very pleased with the entire experience. From the smell of the eucalyptus to the lighting to the incredible food- every detail is well thought out. We had a trio of spreads to start- served with their delicious bread.We also tried the marinated octopus and east coast oysters, both were expectedly fresh and well-prepared. The balance of flavors was amazing. We also had the dolmades- initial sweet flavor turns spicey from the hot pepper labne. We then tried all of the desserts- as we are a follower of Ryan Westover. The baklava was paired with mandarin sherbet- a surprising flavor combo. I could taste the delicious flavors of the baklava, as it wasn't sticky sweet as per the norm in other places. The lemon cake was tart and expertly paired with thyme meringue- cool flavor- and labne ice cream. I'm normally a chocolate fan, but the cake was a tangy treat. The apple tartlet was good- but when enjoyed with the salted caramel ice cream, it was amazing. Not too caramel dominant, which is typical. And lastly- the chocolate dish. Mousse-like, melt in your mouth. pomegranate accent- this was my favorite. The entire meal- from ambiance to food- was incredible. The service was stellar and I felt that we had a new friend by dinner end.
Came in for a quick business lunch with 3 coworkers. The food is probably some of the freshest best tasting in the area! I can't remember the last time I had such tender lamb. Our server was very knowledgable, he was able to answer all of our questions. We had the seafood tower it was amazing crab, lobster, oysters, shrimp cocktail, salmon tartare, marinated mussels, marinated octopus. Will definitely be back!!!
i live right down the street from this place and could not wait for it to open up!I went by for brunch and it was delicious, cannot recommend it enough!!!I will be going there regularly for dinner!
Kapnos Taverna's opening has been long awaited, and reflect a changing Ballston, which is not exactly a dining mecca. I've only been working here two years, and I'm already bored with the options, though that is changing as well.I was excited for Kapnos, though I also had some trepidation, as I've not been a fan of Isabella restaurants. I'd hoped I would be wrong with Kapnos, and I was. I loved everything that I ordered for lunch.This mezze spot offers some great options, and I chose the hummus, saganaki, and fried eggplant. The hummus was creamy and quite lemony, but what wowed me was the flatbread. It's not pita, it's not laffa, but it's almost naan-like. Saganaki is always a favorite of mine, and this is served bubbling hot. I would prefer a completely savory version, though the herbed honey topping would not prevent me from ordering it again. However, I did enjoy the sweet/savory combination of the fried eggplant with spicy honey. The honey is quite spicy, which I love, and the eggplant was perfect.The service is excellent. Everyone I encountered was friendly and enthusiastic, and well-versed in the menu.The vibe is trendy, with what I'd term as lounge music playing. The restaurant is fairly open, with a small bar area downstairs, and plenty of seating on each of its two floors. Plenty of windows offer natural light, making the wrought-iron, dark wood, and deep blue walls work well. My only concern is the noise level.I can absolutely see myself as a regular at Kapnos Taverna.
